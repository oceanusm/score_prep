Rink Rats Chapter 1: First Day Kyle looked at his reflection in the mirror. He studied the lines etched on his face, each one a reminder of the years gone by. A hint of gray threaded his hair now, and for a moment, he felt the weight of change settling in.  He didn’t want to label it an identity crisis. Not yet at least. But as he splashed the cold sink water on his face, memories of his pro hockey career flooded his mind. The thrill of the game, the adrenaline of competition, the love of the fans. All forty years of his life had practically been dedicated to making it to the highest level. Now those days were behind him.
It had been a remarkable twenty-year pro career, one that most players could only dream of. He wore a gleaming championship ring, a testament to his hard work and dedication. Kyle truly couldn’t have asked for more. With his wife and son by his side through every triumph and challenge, he was ready to step into this new chapter and return the favor they had shown him. Today marked a significant milestone for the Barnes family; Ryan’s first day of school in their new town. After Kyle’s retirement, they had chosen to relocate to New Hampshire so Ryan could attend St. Cassian’s, the prestigious hockey prep school where Kyle had once played.
It was usually his wife, Nicole, who ensured that milestones like this were executed flawlessly. But with his career behind him and plenty of free time ahead, they decided it was time to switch roles. After dedicating fifteen years to raising their son, Nicole was finally ready to return to work full-time and pursue her passion for interior design, leaving Kyle to navigate this unfamiliar routine on his own.  Kyle knew he should be excited, yet uncertainty tugged at him. Taking a deep breath, he forced himself to focus. It was time for Nicole and Ryan to take the lead, with his unwavering support behind them. He was determined not to let them down.
“Fresh start,” he whispered to himself. “You got this.”  Kyle followed the enticing aroma of fresh coffee to the kitchen. Nicole was in the final moments of her new morning routine, screwing the lid onto her to-go cup. When she caught sight of him out of the corner of her eye, she flashed him a quick, warm smile. “Morning, Mr. Mom,” she said, her voice bright with excitement. “Morning,” he chuckled, closing the distance between them and pressing a kiss to her lips. “Pretty sure morning coffee is my new responsibility.” “You get a freebie today, rookie.” Nicole slung her purse over her shoulder and gave Kyle an encouraging pat on the backside as she passed him. “Alright, I’m outta here. Ryan needs to be downstairs in five minutes, and you two need to be out the door in ten. And don’t forget to snap at least one picture of him in his new uniform. I want a smile, or it doesn’t count!”
“I’ll make sure he gets to school on time. No promises about the smiling part, though.” “If he behaves for the picture, tell him we can hit the diner after practice.” “Deal.” Kyle nodded. “Go get ’em, babe.” Nicole winked at him as she opened the door to the garage. “Love you. Keep me updated!” And just like that, she was gone. The sudden silence was almost unsettling, prompting Kyle to pour himself a cup of coffee to distract his restless thoughts. “Hey, Ry! You about ready?” Kyle called up the stairs. Silence followed, typical for a teenager. Kyle settled at the table for the time being, scrolling through his phone. A new text pinged, and he tapped on it.
“Barnesy.” It was from his old teammate, Luc Benoit, now coaching St. Cassian’s hockey team. “Need a favor. Meet me at the rink soon?”  “Already need my advice on day one, Benny?” Kyle shot a teasing text back. “Just trying to keep you busy, old man.”  Kyle smiled at the jab. Even after all these years, their relationship had remained as lively and playful as it was in their twenties. ”Be there in fifteen. Bout to drop off Ry.”  “Shit,” he muttered under his breath when he checked the time. “Ryan William!” he yelled up the stairs. “If we’re late on your first day, your mom is going to skin me, and then I’m gonna skin you! Let’s go!”
“I’m coming!”  Kyle pushed back from the table and swiftly poured his coffee from his favorite mug into a to-go cup. A moment later, the sound of hurried footsteps echoed down the stairs behind him. He grabbed his keys from the counter and turned to face his son. “Got everything?” Kyle asked. He took in the sight in front of him; his heart swelling with pride and a touch of nostalgia seeing his old school colors on his boy.  “Yeah,” Ryan replied, tucking his school polo into his khaki pants. He noticed the warm expression on his dad’s face. “What’s with the look?”
“Royal blue and gold really suit you, Champ.” Ryan smirked and rolled his eyes. “You’re getting so soft in your old age.”  “Is that so?”  With a playful grin, Kyle reached out to pinch the crook of Ryan’s neck, a gesture that had always made his son laugh. Ryan burst into genuine laughter, tucking his chin and batting at Kyle’s hand to dodge the attack. “Okay, okay!” “That’s what I thought. Come on, let’s get moving.” Kyle smiled and gave Ryan’s backside a light swat, nudging him along. They stepped outside, where the morning sun cast a warm glow over their freshly painted house, a vivid reminder of their recent move back to New England.
The atmosphere in the car was charged with a blend of anticipation and anxiety. Kyle could sense Ryan’s nervous energy radiating beside him, and he couldn’t help but remember his own first day, driven by his dad to this very school. He understood, probably more than anyone, the mix of excitement and fear his son was feeling. As they pulled into the school parking lot, Kyle exhaled, taking in the stunning, castle-like buildings. He remembered just how much he loved this campus, especially in the fall when the foliage was at its peak. “Ready, buddy?” Kyle asked, glancing over as Ryan fiddled with his backpack in the passenger seat.
“Yeah, I think so,” Ryan replied, his voice steady despite the nervous flutter in his stomach. There was a determination in his eyes that reassured Kyle. “Hey, you’ll do great,” Kyle said, offering a comforting smile. “But before you head to class, Mom wants a quick picture.” Ryan groaned, anticipating the familiar routine. “Do we have to—” “Ryan,” Kyle replied, his tone light but firm. “Less attitude, please. You know the drill.” They stepped out of the car, and Kyle quickly snapped a picture he knew Nicole would cherish. It wasn’t Ryan’s most enthusiastic smile, but it was a smile nonetheless.
“I’ll see you at practice, okay?” Kyle wrapped an arm around Ryan’s shoulders, pulling him close and pressing a kiss to his soft, blonde curls. “Have a great day. Love you.” “Love you too.” Kyle stood for a moment, watching as Ryan disappeared through the arched doorway of the main building. As the door swung shut behind his son, Kyle took a deep breath, knowing this was just the beginning of a new journey for them both. After a lifetime of strict schedules, the idea of an open day felt both liberating and daunting. So when Luc’s text came through this morning, Kyle was genuinely relieved, and a little thrilled, to have somewhere to be.
He made his way across campus toward the Griffin Den, the school’s storied ice rink, coffee in hand. The crisp morning air and familiar surroundings stirred something deep in his chest. Kyle pushed open the doors to the rink, and the familiar scent of ice, rubber, and old gear hit him instantly. For the first time that day, he felt like himself. He stood in the stillness, letting the silence wash over him as he gazed out at the freshly zambonied sheet of ice, smooth and untouched, like a blank page waiting to be written on.  Kyle glanced up at the banners hanging from the rafters, his eyes quickly finding the year he and Luc had won their championship. The sight pulled him back in time, memories flooding in all at once, sharp and vivid, like the ice was still beneath his skates.
Suddenly, a voice cut through his thoughts. “The good ol’ days, eh, Barnesy?” Kyle turned to see Luc emerging from his office, a grin on his face as he walked over. Kyle resisted the urge to roll his eyes at that grin. It was annoying as hell that Luc still looked like he belonged on the cover of GQ , even after a grueling pro hockey career of his own. “Just what I needed, another reminder that I’m getting old,” Kyle said with a chuckle. “It’s surreal being back. Seeing all this again…it feels like a lifetime ago.” “You’ll get used to it,” Luc said with a smile, reaching out for a firm handshake and pulling Kyle into a quick shoulder-clap hug, the kind of greeting that hadn’t changed since they were teammates.
Kyle noticed the file in Luc's hand, its edges worn from use. “What’s this? Got a scouting report for me?” he asked, curiosity piqued as he leaned in slightly, eager to hear what Luc had to share. “This,” Luc hummed as he tapped the file with his free hand, “is the favor. I’ll fill you in on the details. Come on, let’s sit.” Kyle looked momentarily puzzled but settled onto the cold metal bleachers beside him. ”So, we’ve got a last-minute addition, and usually we don’t make exceptions, right? Once the roster is finalized over the summer, that’s typically it,” Luc began. “But this kid is something special. I’m telling you, man, he’s got insane potential.”
Luc handed the file to Kyle, who opened it with interest. "Declan Avery Hull" was printed in bold letters across the top, accompanied by a photo paperclipped to the top right corner. Kyle mentally noted the boyish features: deep green eyes, shiny, long, floppy brunette hair, and a bold expression that suggested confidence. His gaze then shifted to the hockey resume, and he raised his eyebrows at its impressive details. Kyle let out a low whistle, the sound escaping him like a mix of surprise and admiration. “Damn, this kid is going to be a stud.” “Just wait until you see him play, he arrives tomorrow,” Luc said, his tone shifting slightly. “But I do have some concerns.”
“With what?” Kyle asked, unable to find anything amiss in the details his eyes were scanning on the page. Luc flipped to the back, where the more personal information was stored, and pointed to the notes section with his finger. Kyle read the first bullet point: “Off-ice behavior must be addressed if he wants to reach his full potential.” His eyebrows instinctively raised at that, a knowing look passing between them as he turned to Luc. “Sounds like he’s a bit of a wildcard, huh?” Luc sighed, shaking his head as he fell deep into thought. “I don’t want to make excuses for him. Hell, I don’t even know him yet. But the kid has been bouncing from boarding school to boarding school for most of his childhood. That can’t be helping, right? I think what he really needs is stability.”
“Where are the parents?” Kyle asked, the question feeling all too obvious given his own experiences.  He and Nicole had made it a priority to effectively manage their son’s off-ice behavior throughout his upbringing, committed to ensuring no negative bullet points marred his hockey resume. Any acting out was always nipped in the bud, immediately. “Mom’s not in the picture; hasn’t been since he was a baby, from what I hear,” Luc replied. “And the dad isn’t very present; he doesn’t show up to any games. Just writes the checks when he needs to.” “Shit,” was all Kyle could manage in response.
“Yeah,” Luc sighed, shaking his head in frustration. “I just don’t feel right being just another boarding school for him, you know? He needs something more, something different. He needs a hockey family .” Kyle couldn’t agree more; he felt a deep empathy for the kid. Having experienced the support of a tight-knit hockey family throughout his own career, he understood how crucial that foundation was. “How can I help, Benny?” he asked, his tone sincere. “I thought about taking the kid in, but I know he won’t want to live with the coach,” Luc began. “I realize this is a big ask, and I won’t be offended if you say no-“
Kyle cut in, finishing Luc’s thought. “You want us to be his billet family.” Luc nodded thoughtfully. “I’ve seen firsthand how you and Nicole raised Ryan, and just look at how incredible he turned out. If Declan has a support system like yours, it could be a game changer for him.” Kyle took a moment to ponder. This wasn’t merely a simple favor; this was a responsibility for another soul. He hadn’t anticipated considering taking in a kid when he read Luc’s text that morning. Still, he would do anything for Luc, and the earnest look in his eyes made it clear just how serious this was to him. That meant it was now serious to Kyle as well.
“I hear you, and I appreciate that you think so highly of me,” Kyle said, a teasing smile playing on his lips. “Let me chat with Nicole and Ryan over dinner tonight, and I’ll get back to you, okay? I’m confident we can work something out.” “I really appreciate it, man,” Luc said earnestly. “As a thank you for even considering it, feel free to use the gym here whenever you want. We don’t want you developing a dad bod, now do we?” he teased, giving Kyle’s stomach a playful pat.  “Don’t you dare start that with me, you little sh—” Kyle retorted, unable to suppress a grin.
“Got a meeting to run to!” Luc exclaimed, rising from the bleachers and jogging toward the coaches office before Kyle could finish his thought. “Keep that file tonight, just bring it back tomorrow. Love you!” “Yeah, yeah,” Kyle said, rolling his eyes with a chuckle. A mix of emotions stirred within Kyle as he found himself alone in the rink once more. The weight of the decision ahead loomed large, but he felt a flicker of hope. If there was a chance to make a difference for Declan, perhaps it was worth taking the leap. He took a deep breath, glancing around the rink where memories flooded back once again: laughter, camaraderie, and the family he cherished. This new chapter was unfolding, a fresh purpose, and maybe it was finally time to embrace the unknown.
“Okay, we’ve got two classic burgers, one club sandwich, and fries all around,” the waitress announced cheerfully as she placed each plate on the table with practiced ease. “Can I get you anything else?” “I think we’re all set, thanks, Jo,” Kyle said with a warm smile as he shifted his napkin onto his lap. The Barnes family began digging in after the waitress left them to it. Ryan immediately reached for the ketchup and, true to form, drowned his fries in an absurd amount, completely unfazed by the amused glances from his parents. Without a word, Kyle plucked the pickles from his burger and placed them on Ryan’s plate; a quiet ritual that had long become second nature. It was a small thing, but moments like that made Kyle feel grounded, like some parts of life hadn’t changed at all.
The table fell into a comfortable silence as everyone tucked into their meals, the clinking of silverware and the occasional satisfied hum filling the space between them. After a few minutes of quiet eating, Kyle leaned back slightly and broke the silence, ready to reconnect with his family. “Alright,” he hummed, taking a sip of his drink before setting the glass down. “Big day for all of us, huh? Who’s up first, anyone want to share?” ”Oh, I’ll go,” Nicole said, her eyes lighting up. “As much as I love you, my beautiful boys, it was so nice to be back at the office today. Everyone was incredibly welcoming. Today was mostly administrative stuff, but we also talked through some upcoming projects, and I’m already itching to dive in.”
Kyle smiled, genuinely happy to see her so energized. “That’s awesome, babe. You’ve been waiting a long time for this.” “Yeah,” Ryan added between bites. “Mom’s finally getting to make other people’s houses look as cool as ours.” “Exactly!” Nicole cooed, giving Ryan’s bicep a soft pinch. “Though I do still expect your help moving samples around the garage, Mr. Muscles.” Ryan groaned with a grin. “Knew that was coming.” Kyle chuckled at their banter, then shifted in his seat, draping his arm around the back of Ryan’s chair so he could fully face him. As he moved, he gave the back of Ryan’s head a gentle scruff, earning a mock-annoyed eye roll from his son.
“Alright, your turn, Champ. First day at St. Cassian’s, how’d it go?” Ryan shrugged, poking at a fry. “It was alright.” “Just alright?” Nicole asked, raising an eyebrow.  “I mean, it’s school. But the campus is pretty sick, and a couple of the guys on the team seemed cool. Classes weren’t bad either.” Kyle nodded, his gaze steady. “That’s a solid start.” Ryan gave another shrug, but this time it came with a small smile. “Yeah, I guess it wasn’t the worst first day.” Kyle began rubbing a slow circle between Ryan’s shoulder blades absentmindedly, his gaze drifting to the window beside them. The sun was beginning to dip below the trees, casting golden streaks across the diner’s parking lot, a reminder of how quickly time was already passing.
“Hey,” Kyle hummed, giving Ryan’s shoulder a light squeeze to catch his attention. “Tell your mom about practice. She’s been waiting all day to hear about it.” Ryan perked up, his eyes brightening a little. “The rink’s insane, it’s like NHL-level. Uncle Luc- I mean, Coach Luc had us doing some light drills, mostly puck work and conditioning,” he said, trying to keep his voice even, though the excitement peeked through.  “Yeah?” Nicole leaned in, genuinely curious. “Did it feel like the right fit?” Ryan nodded. “Yeah. Everyone’s really good, but I think I held my own. Coach Luc kept it pretty easy on us for the first day, but I know it’s gonna ramp up fast.”
“I’m so glad to hear that, baby,” Nicole said, reaching across the table to touch Ryan’s arm. Her fingers shifted, and she gave his chin a light tap with her knuckle. “Even if that smile in the picture your dad took this morning was, like, 40% effort at best.” “I smiled, didn’t I?” Ryan laughed, ducking his head.  “Technically,” she teased, leaning back with a grin. “I have half a mind to make you retake it tomorrow.” “Nope,” Ryan said quickly, already shaking his head. “One per semester. That’s the rule.” Kyle chuckled into his drink. “He’s been keeping track, apparently.”
Kyle watched the exchange with a quiet sense of contentment, the easy rhythm between Nicole and Ryan filling him with a familiar warmth. Then his gaze dropped to his plate, the weight of the earlier conversation with Luc nudging at the back of his mind. The time had come to shift gears. He gave Nicole a small smile, then cleared his throat gently. “So, while we’re all sharing big firsts today,” Kyle began, his voice casual but deliberate, “there’s one more thing I wanted to run by you guys.” Nicole looked up from her plate, brows knitting slightly with curiosity. “Everything okay?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Kyle said quickly, waving a hand to ease the concern. “It’s nothing bad. Just…something Luc brought up this morning when I saw him at the rink.” Ryan glanced up from his fries, picking up on the subtle shift in his dad’s tone. His posture straightened slightly, curiosity taking hold. “He asked me for a favor,” Kyle continued, glancing between them. “And it’s kind of a big one.” Ryan raised an eyebrow, still chewing a fry. “Like, helping him move a couch kind of favor, or helping bury a body kind of favor?” Nicole shot Ryan a disapproving look, but Kyle couldn’t help but chuckle. “It’s somewhere in between, I think.”
Ryan leaned back in his chair, taking a sip of his drink. “Okay, well now I’m really curious. What is it?”  Kyle shifted in his seat, removing his arm from the back of Ryan's chair and leaning forward slightly, resting his forearms on the table. “Luc asked if we’d consider being a billet family this season, for a new player joining the team.” Nicole paused, setting down her glass with a thoughtful clink. “He wants us to take in a kid?” Her expression morphed, less surprise and more intrigue. “That’s definitely not something Luc would ask lightly.” Kyle nodded. “Exactly. This kid, Declan Hull, he’s talented, no question. But his home life’s rocky. Luc thinks living with a stable family could really ground him.”
Ryan glanced between his parents, concern creeping into his expression. “Wait…does that mean he’d be, like, living with me? Am I going to have to share my room?”  Kyle met his eyes, offering a calm look to ease the concern. “He’ll be in the guest room, don’t worry. And honestly, part of why Luc thought of us is because he said you’d be a great example for him.” Ryan leaned forward, mirroring his dad’s posture with his forearms on the table, his brows knitting together in thought. “Why wasn’t he at practice today then? If he’s on the team, shouldn’t he have started with the rest of us?”
Kyle nodded, understanding the question. He knew how important it was for a team to start the season together; same drills, same ice, building that early chemistry.  “Luc said things came together really last minute, the paperwork just cleared. Declan gets in tomorrow, but he’s already locked in on the roster.” Ryan tilted his head, clearly still processing. “Huh…that’s kind of wild. Just showing up outta nowhere.” Kyle gently bumped his shoulder into Ryan’s, his voice steady. “Life isn’t always neat, Ry. This kid’s been bounced around for years, not because he’s a bad kid, but because no one’s given him a real chance. This might be his shot at something solid. So let’s not judge him before we even meet him, okay?”
Ryan pouted slightly at the soft scolding, his shoulders sinking just a bit. He looked down at his plate, quiet for a moment as he pushed a fry through the last streak of ketchup.  “So he’s my age?” he asked, his voice more thoughtful now. Kyle nodded. “Same grade. He’ll turn fifteen in May,” he said, watching Ryan closely for a reaction. But nothing came. Ryan simply continued to eat the last of his fries, prompting Kyle to press on. “You okay with that?” he asked gently. “It’s a big shift, I know.” Ryan shrugged, then nodded slowly. “I mean…yeah. I get it. If he really needs it, I’m not gonna be a jerk about it. Just gotta wrap my head around having a roommate now, I guess.”
Before Kyle could respond, Nicole quickly interjected. “If you weren’t okay with it, that wouldn’t make you a jerk, sweetheart. Do you understand? It’s natural to feel unsure, and you have the biggest heart I’ve ever seen, even when you try to hide it.” Ryan gave a half-smile, eyes flicking toward his plate again. Nicole glanced at Kyle, then back to Ryan. “And if this boy really needs a place to land, I think we’d be the right kind of home for him. It won’t be perfect, and it’ll probably take some adjusting, but we’ve got more to give. We always have.”
She looked at Kyle now, and his heart swelled. He reached for Nicole’s hand under the table and gave it a gentle squeeze. ”I think it’s worth a shot, yeah?” Kyle nodded, his voice steady as he looked between the two of them. “But just so there’s no confusion, family comes first. It always has, and it always will.” Nicole gave a small, knowing smile, and Ryan met his dad’s eyes, listening closely. “We’ll do our best to make this work,” Kyle continued, “but if it doesn’t feel right, if it’s too much or causes strain in the house, then we reassess. No guilt. No pressure. Just honesty.”
He paused for a beat. “But something tells me we might be exactly what this kid needs.” Nicole reached for her water and nodded. “And maybe he’s exactly what we need too.” Ryan leaned back in his seat, nudging his empty plate aside. “So…does finding out I’ve got a roommate now at least get me a to-go milkshake or something?” Nicole raised an eyebrow, clearly amused. “Oh, we’re negotiating now?” “I mean, emotional growth is exhausting,” Ryan said with a grin. “I think I’ve earned some sugar.” Kyle laughed, reaching for the check. “Fair enough. One chocolate milkshake, extra whipped cream. You definitely earned it.”
As they stood and gathered their things, the air around them felt lighter. They stepped out of the diner as one, Kyle’s arm draped protectively over Ryan’s shoulders, his other hand gently clasping Nicole’s. There was still a lot unknown about what lay ahead, but they were facing it together. And that, Kyle thought, was more than a good start. The house was quiet again. The kind of quiet that settles in only after a full day. Kyle padded barefoot down the hallway, coffee mug in one hand, Declan’s file tucked under his arm. The bedroom light cast a warm glow across the sheets as Nicole emerged from the bathroom, brushing out the last bit of moisture from her hair. She wore one of Kyle’s old team t-shirts, the fabric soft and oversized, sleeves brushing her elbows.
Kyle was already propped up against the headboard when she climbed into bed beside him, pulling the covers over her lap with a contented sigh. “Ry asleep?” Nicole murmured, easing into his side, her fingers brushing lightly against his arm. “Mhm,” Kyle hummed, setting his mug down on the nightstand with a soft clink. The folder remained open on his lap, Declan’s profile page catching the soft pool of lamplight. Nicole’s gaze drifted to it. “You’ve read that three times already,” she said softly. “Yeah,” Kyle admitted, eyes still on the page. “I keep thinking about how young he looks. He’s just a kid. But there’s something in his eyes…I don’t know. It’s like he’s already carrying the weight of someone twice his age.”
Nicole leaned her head against his shoulder, her hand finding his on the file and resting there. “You’re already in it, huh?” Kyle let out a breath through his nose; half a laugh, half a sigh. “I don’t know. Maybe. I just…I keep picturing what it would’ve been like for me at his age without my dad showing up to every game. Without someone giving a damn.” Nicole was quiet for a moment, her thumb gently tracing his knuckles. “We’re good at giving a damn,” she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. Kyle turned to look at her, his expression soft. “You sure you’re up for this? Things were just starting to feel…balanced.”
“I’m sure,” she said, meeting his eyes. “We’ve always made room when it mattered. This matters.” “And Ryan?” Kyle’s voice dipped, laced with quiet guilt. “I promised him this next chapter would be about him. More time together, just the two of us; his hockey, his moment. And now, day one, I’m asking him to share all of that with a complete stranger.” “What if it’s good for him too?” Nicole asked gently, her voice thoughtful. “Learning how to make space for someone else. Figuring out who he is not just on the ice, but as a teammate, a friend. Maybe even a brother.”
Kyle hadn’t considered that angle, not really. The idea settled over him slowly, unexpected but not unwelcome, like a shift in light that made the whole picture look different. “Damn,” Kyle murmured, a quiet smile tugging at his lips. “You’re good.” Nicole grinned, tilting her head as she bumped her shoulder against his. “That’s why you married me, Barnes.” “Among a million other reasons,” he said, leaning over to press a kiss to her temple. “I love you.” She smirked sleepily. “I love you too. Now turn off that light. We’ve got another big day tomorrow.”  Kyle chuckled, snapping the folder shut. He placed it gently on the nightstand beside his mug, then clicked off the lamp.
As darkness settled around them, he lay back beside her, one arm beneath her shoulders, the steady rhythm of her breathing already beginning to slow. And for a long while, Kyle stared at the ceiling, wide awake. Tomorrow, everything would begin again. New roles. New routines. A new kid. A new chance.
Chapter 2: First Impressions The bus hissed as it came to a stop in front of St. Cassian’s entrance, its doors folding open with a mechanical sigh.  Declan Hull sat in the second-to-last row, elbows propped on his knees, thumbs drumming anxiously against each other. His headphones rested around his neck, the music paused a while ago, but he hadn’t noticed. He’d spent the last hour watching pine trees blur past the window, wondering if this place would be like the others.
Temporary. With a slow exhale, Declan rose to his feet, slinging the duffel bag over his shoulder. The blue canvas was stiff and new, the St. Cassian’s crest embroidered in gold on the side. It had been overnighted to him in anticipation for his arrival, along with his class uniform and team-issued hockey sweats. He’d conveniently ignored the uniform, pulling on the sweats instead. After seven hours crammed on a bus from Syracuse, he dared someone to say a word about him showing up late and out of dress code.  The driver gave him a brief nod as he stepped off the bus.
The fall air was colder than he expected, brisk and sharp as it hit his lungs. He zipped his windbreaker up higher and adjusted his grip on the bag. His eyes scanned the wide campus, tracing the stone buildings and manicured lawns with casual disinterest until they landed on the rink in the distance. There it was. The reason he was here. Hockey was the one thing that always made sense, even when everything else didn’t. On the ice, he was free. He could move how he wanted, think how he wanted, and he was good . Nothing else in his life had ever been that simple.
He shifted his bag higher on his shoulder, drawn toward the rink like muscle memory. His feet started moving without him even really deciding to. Then a voice snapped him out of it. “Excuse me, sweetheart! New arrival?” An older woman in a St. Cassian’s blazer was waving him down from the main entrance, clipboard in hand and a no-nonsense energy that made him stop in his tracks. “Uh, yeah,” he said, squinting against the sun. “I’m Declan. Declan Hull.” “Oh, hi, Declan.” She smiled as she caught up to him, a little out of breath but friendly. “I’m Heather Burke, Director of Admissions.” She extended her hand with practiced warmth, like she’d done this a hundred times before.
“Hi,” Declan said, reaching out to shake her hand. His grip was firm, but quick; polite enough, though his eyes kept drifting back toward the rink. She noticed the way his gaze kept pulling back to the rink and smiled knowingly. “You’re ready to get after it, aren’t you?” she said with a spark of encouragement. “Well, no point in delaying. I know your coaches are looking forward to meeting you. Shall we?” She turned, already walking toward the rink, trusting he’d follow. Declan didn’t say a word, just adjusted his grip on the duffel and fell in step, eyes fixed straight ahead.
”So,” she hummed, breaking the silence, “you missed the first two days of classes. I’ve got all your classwork and homework here.”  She handed him a folder as they walked; blue and gold, stamped with the school crest in shiny foil. Declan almost rolled his eyes. Even the homework was branded. “Normally, we have a zero-tolerance policy for late work,” she continued. “But given the circumstances, you’ll have until the end of the week to get it turned in. If you need a tutor to help you catch up, that can be arranged.” Declan’s brain buzzed, already overloaded by the flood of expectations and deadlines. Heather must’ve picked up on it. She gave him a brief pat on the back, like that would somehow make it better.
"Don’t worry, everything you need to know is in the school handbook," she said, her tone casual, as though she was well-accustomed to the overwhelmed look on new students’ faces. Right . The endless handbook they emailed over. As if he’d actually sit down and read all that. Before Declan’s brain could short-circuit from the overload, Heather pushed open the doors to the rink. The blast of cold air hit him like a welcome shock, instantly calming the chaos in his head. Finally.  “Coach Benoit’s office is just through here,” Heather said, leading him down the hallway.  She knocked on the door, and it swung open immediately. The man who stepped into view was the same one from the school website photo, his broad smile instantly recognizable. He beamed at Declan like an old friend.
“Declan!” he exclaimed with enthusiasm, his smile widening. “Welcome to St. Cassian’s. How was the ride in?” “Long,” Declan said with a shrug, the weight of the journey still lingering in his voice. “But I’m just glad to finally be here.” Luc stepped forward with a confident handshake, his grip firm but welcoming. “We’re thrilled to have you on board.” He turned to Heather with a smile. “Mrs. Burke, thank you for making the trek out to The Den.” She waved him off with an easy smile. “Anytime. If you need me, you know where to find me.” With a final nod, she turned and swept out, her heels clicking in steady rhythm across the rink floor.
“Come on in, Declan,” Luc said as he opened the door and stepped aside to let him through. Declan walked in but hesitated a few steps past the threshold. His gaze landed on a man already in the room, someone he recognized. His posture stiffened. ”Whoa, wait. You’re Kyle Barnes,” Declan said, the corners of his mouth lifting for the first time all day. The weight of the bus ride, the nerves, the folder full of homework gone for a moment. Kyle’s smile was easy, confident. He stepped forward and extended a hand. “Nice to meet you, Declan. I’ve heard a lot about you.”
Declan shook his hand, barely keeping the awe off his face. A breath slipped out, half disbelief, half nerves, and before he could stop himself, his mouth got ahead of his brain. “I had you on my fantasy team last year. Not gonna lie, you lost me the championship.” Declan pressed his lips together the second the words left his mouth, the grin fading as panic crept in. Nice one, he thought. Way to chirp an NHL vet five minutes into meeting him. He resisted the urge to bury his face in his hands. A snicker sounded behind him. Declan glanced over his shoulder to see Coach Luc with a hand half-covering his mouth, doing a poor job of hiding his amusement.
Kyle nodded, the corners of his mouth twitching as he fought back a smile. “Is that right? Sorry to let you down. Guess it’s a good thing I hung up the skates when I did, spare a few more fantasy teams the heartbreak.” Declan opened his mouth, then quickly shut it again, heat creeping up the back of his neck. “I mean…your Cup run with the Kings was insane, though. That game seven OT goal? Unreal.” He scratched the back of his neck. “So… uh, what are you doing at St. Cassian’s? Are you coaching here now? I didn’t see you on the website.”
Luc settled into his chair, the leather creaking softly as he leaned back, then gestured to the seat across from him. “That’s actually what we wanted to talk to you about.” Declan dropped into the chair, his duffel still slung across one shoulder, curiosity flickering behind his eyes. He wasn’t sure what he expected, but something about Luc’s tone made him sit a little straighter. Luc leaned forward, resting his forearms on the desk, his tone shifting; slower now, more deliberate. He glanced over at Kyle, then back to Declan. “Coming to a new school like St. Cassian’s is no small thing. You’re stepping into a new environment, away from home, with big expectations; on the ice, in the classroom, socially. That’s a lot for anyone, even a kid with your talent.”
He let the words breathe for a moment, letting them land before continuing. “When we found out you’d be joining us, one of the first conversations we had was about how to make that transition easier for you. Where you’d land. Who you’d be around. Not just where you sleep at night, but where you’d feel like you had solid ground beneath you.” Luc nodded toward Kyle. “Kyle and his family moved here this summer. His son, Ryan, is one of your new teammates. His wife, Nicole, she’s the kind of person who makes a place feel like home the second you walk in. And Kyle? Well, you know who he is.”
He paused again, not for dramatic effect, but because it mattered. “He’s not on the coaching staff, at least not officially. But he’s part of something new we’re building here. A different kind of support system; player development, mentorship, leadership off the ice as much as on. And we want you to be part of that.” Luc’s smile came easy, a little crooked. “So, here’s the offer: Kyle and his family have opened their home to you. If you’re open to it, we think it’s a great fit. But no pressure. We wanted to bring it to you first.” Declan blinked, caught off guard. He hadn’t expected this. At all.
Every boarding school he’d been to had followed the same formula; dorms, roommates, shared bathrooms, and noise. This? Living off-campus? With a former NHL player and his family? That was…new.  He glanced between Luc and Kyle, trying to read between the lines, to figure out if this was really optional or just dressed up to feel that way. “I thought I’d be living on campus,” he said finally, his voice quieter, not confrontational, just honest. Luc nodded, like he’d anticipated that reaction. “Totally fair. And yeah, most students do. But with your background, and the level we expect you to compete at, we wanted to try something a little different. Give you a foundation.”
Declan shifted in his seat, still trying to wrap his head around it. Living with Kyle Barnes. Having breakfast across the table from the guy who used to light it up in the league. It was a lot to take in. Kyle let out a soft chuckle, picking up on the hesitation in Declan’s eyes. “It’s a lot to process, huh?” Declan didn’t answer, but the look on his face said enough. He watched Kyle carefully, the weight of it all pressing in. Kyle leaned back in his chair, settling into a more relaxed posture, but his eyes stayed sharp and knowing. “I’ve been where you’re sitting. New town. New team. Big pressure. It can mess with your head if you let it.”
Declan’s mind flickered through every worry he’d been carrying since stepping off that bus. Was Kyle reading him that easily? It felt like he was peeling back layers without even trying. That low, familiar buzz of uncertainty crept up again, and somehow, Kyle seemed to catch it without a word. “I know it’s not easy, kid.” Kyle gave a small, almost fatherly sigh. His voice was lower now; gentle, but steady. “But here’s the thing. If you stay with us, you’re not just crashing at a billet house. I’m offering you space to breathe. A place to land when everything else feels like it’s spinning.”
Declan felt his throat tighten. Like the room had gone still for a second. “Hockey’s a hell of a ride,” Kyle went on, “and yeah, I’ll push you. But I’ll have your back every step of the way. This isn’t just about stats or ice time, it’s about becoming the kind of player, the kind of person, who can handle the long haul. And I’ve been through the trenches. I know what that takes.” He folded his arms casually, the edge in his voice softening into something more inviting. “It’s a big decision, I get that. So here’s what I’m thinking, you crash with us tonight. No pressure. See the house, meet Nicole and Ryan. Feel it out. Then tomorrow, if it feels right, we’ll talk.”
Declan didn’t even realize he was nodding until the motion was halfway done. Something about the way Kyle spoke; calm, direct, like he actually got it. It cut through the usual static in Declan’s brain. He didn’t know what was happening, not really. Just that, for some reason, this guy already had a kind of hold on him. Not in a forced way. Just…steady. Solid. Like someone who meant what he said and wouldn’t flake the second things got hard. No adult had ever made him feel that before. Not a teacher. Not a coach. Not even his own dad.
So yeah, maybe he wasn’t sure about any of this, but his head kept nodding anyway. “Okay,” he said finally. “I’ll give it a shot.” Luc and Kyle exchanged a quick smile, something quiet and satisfied passing between them. "Great!" Luc said, his enthusiasm palpable. He leaned forward, a spark in his eyes. "Any questions or anything on your mind before you head out to practice?" Declan paused, the question hanging in the air for a moment. He glanced between Luc and Kyle, then shook his head. "I think I’m good for now." "Alright, go ahead and get settled in," Luc said, standing up and motioning toward the hallway. "Locker room's down the hall to the right. Your name’s on one of the stalls, and your gear's already waiting for you."
Declan rose to his feet, clutching the duffel a little tighter. Luc gave him a nod. “Practice starts in twenty. Coach Reynolds will meet you on the ice.” Kyle stood too, that same calm energy still radiating off him. “I’ll see you after. Nicole’s making chicken parm tonight. Hope you’re hungry.” Declan gave a half-smile without meaning to. “Yeah. Sounds good.” And with that, he turned and headed for the hallway, trying not to overthink the million things racing through his head. Practice flew by in a blur of crisp passes, sharp turns, and the unmistakable rush that only came when his skates hit fresh ice. Declan didn’t need time to adjust to that, his instincts kicked in from the first drill. It wasn’t long before heads were turning and quiet nods of approval passed between coaches.
It felt good. Easy. Like slipping into something that had always fit. The locker room buzzed with post-practice energy; snapping tape, the thud of gear hitting benches, and a steady stream of chirps flying from stall to stall. “Not bad for the new guy,” one of the defensemen called, grinning as he peeled off his jersey.  Declan smirked as he unstrapped his pads. “Figured I’d show up, impress a little, then humble you tomorrow.” A few guys let out loud “Oooohs,” one of them chucking a rolled-up sock at him. As he dodged the sock, Declan caught Ryan watching him from across the room. Not in a hostile way, just…quietly. Studying. Like he was still deciding what to make of him.
Before Declan could read into it, Ryan stood, tugged his hoodie over damp hair, and headed out without a word. The rest of the guys were still laughing and joking around, but that moment stuck. Declan finished peeling off his gear and slung the duffel over his shoulder. When he stepped out into the hallway, he spotted them; Kyle and Ryan, standing just outside the rink doors. Kyle’s hand rested on his son’s shoulder, his voice low and calm, the kind of tone only a dad could pull off. Ryan nodded at something, eyes on the ground. Declan didn’t catch what was said, but he could tell instantly that they were close. Really close.
It hit him in a way he didn’t expect. Kyle glanced up and spotted Declan, a smile already forming as he lifted a hand in an easy wave. “There he is. You survive your first Coach Luc practice?” Declan nodded, catching up to them. “Barely,” he said, though the grin tugging at the corner of his mouth gave him away. Ryan gave him a short glance, but didn’t say much. Just gave a subtle nod, then walked ahead toward the parking lot. “Come on,” Kyle said, clapping a hand gently on Declan’s back. “Let’s get you home.” Home. The word sounded weird in his head. But as he followed them to the car, something in his chest loosened, just a little.
The car ride was quiet in a way Declan hadn’t realized he’d been craving. No one asked him questions or tried to fill the silence with small talk. Ryan had earbuds in, staring out his window. Kyle kept one hand on the wheel, the other resting casually on the console, humming now and then to the classic rock playing softly through the speakers. Declan leaned his head against the window and watched the world roll by. The narrow roads wound through thick trees brushed with the first touches of fall; burnt oranges, deep reds, and gold. It was nothing like the city. The quiet felt intentional here. Peaceful.
He hadn’t noticed any of this from the bus, just the ache in his back and the buzz of nerves. But now…now it didn’t seem so bad. The car turned off the main road and onto a quiet, tree-lined street, the tires humming softly against the worn asphalt. Declan glanced out the window, taking in the quaint homes tucked into the hillsides, most with wide porches and tidy yards. Everything felt still out here, like the whole world had taken a breath and held it. They pulled into a modest driveway in front of a two-story house with deep blue siding and white trim. Warm yellow light glowed from the windows, casting a soft welcome as twilight settled over the neighborhood.
Kyle eased the car into park, the soft hum of the engine cutting through the quiet of the evening. He turned to look at Declan with a small smile. “This is us. Home sweet home,” he said, his tone light but with a quiet certainty, as if he were laying down an unspoken promise. Declan didn’t answer, but he opened the door and stepped out. The air smelled faintly of pine and chimney smoke. Calmer than anything he’d felt in weeks. Ryan was already unlocking the front door, his silhouette framed by the porch light. Kyle gave Declan’s shoulder a gentle tap before heading up the steps. “Come on. Nicole’s got dinner waiting, and she’s been asking about you all day.”
The door swung open with a quiet creak, and warm air spilled out into the cool evening, carrying the unmistakable smell of garlic and tomato sauce. Declan stepped inside behind Kyle, the hardwood floors smooth under his sneakers and the house glowing with soft, ambient light that gave it a lived-in, welcoming feel. “Hi!” a voice called from the kitchen. A moment later, a woman stepped out, wiping her hands on a dish towel. She was tall, athletic, with a sharp but warm energy that instantly filled the space. “You must be Declan.” Declan hesitated for a moment, caught in the awkwardness of the moment. He nodded, unsure whether to wave or offer a handshake, his mind scrambling for a response. “Uh, yeah. Hi.”
Before he could say anything else, Nicole stepped forward, her arms open in a welcoming embrace. She pulled him into a hug without missing a beat. “It’s so nice to meet you!” she said, rubbing his back gently in a motherly way before pulling back from the hug. “I’m Nicole. Hope you’re hungry, I made chicken parm. It’s a family favorite.” “Yeah…starving, actually.” Ryan had already disappeared upstairs, his footsteps fading above them, leaving the three of them in the open kitchen and living room. Declan took in the house. Family photos lined the walls, the dining table was half-set, and the smell from the kitchen was enough to make his stomach growl. Everything felt grounded, like people lived here and liked living here.
Nicole gestured toward a stool at the island. “Sit, relax. Dinner’ll be ready in a few. Any food allergies I should know about?” “Nope.” Kyle was already pulling plates from the cabinet. “He held his own at practice,” he said casually over his shoulder, like it was no big deal. Nicole raised a brow at Declan. “Impressive. First day and already showing off?” He shrugged, a flicker of pride sneaking into his chest. “Just trying to keep up.” It felt…comfortable in a way he hadn’t expected. Like maybe, for once, he wouldn’t have to brace himself all the time. By the time they sat down for dinner, that feeling hadn't gone away.
Declan hesitated only for a second before sliding into his seat next to Ryan, who was already digging in like it was a competitive sport. He glanced at his own portion and, after a quick taste, instantly understood why. The chicken parm was insanely good. Declan took another bite, savoring the perfect balance of crispy breading and rich marinara. The flavors were way better than he expected, so much so that he couldn't help but mutter, “This is fucking good.” The second the words left his mouth, the room fell dead silent. Ryan’s fork froze halfway to his mouth, his eyes snapping up to Declan with a mixture of shock and disbelief, like Declan had just unleashed a bomb at the dinner table.
Declan, unaware of the shift, continued chewing, casually glancing around the table, still absorbed in the taste of his food. Then he noticed it. The tension. The quiet. Kyle’s voice broke the silence, calm but carrying an unmistakable authority. “Declan,” he said, his tone measured. “We don’t use that kind of language, especially not at the dinner table.” Declan blinked, caught off guard. “Oh. Um, we...we’re hockey players though,” he shrugged, trying to brush it off. “It's kind of part of the deal.” Kyle didn’t smile. His face remained impassive, though there was a flicker of something in his eyes, a reminder that this wasn’t some casual request. “Maybe on the ice, yeah, but even then, you’re too young for that kind of talk.”
Declan’s brow furrowed, his words tripping over themselves. “You- what?” Kyle’s gaze was steady, never wavering. “In this house, we keep it clean. We respect the people we’re around.” Declan's confusion was evident as he leaned over to Ryan, lowering his voice. “You don’t talk like that?” he asked, genuinely curious, not sure what to make of it all. Before Ryan could answer, Nicole's voice rang out, light but firm. “Not if he doesn’t want soap in his mouth.” Ryan’s eyes widened comically, panic creeping into his voice. “Mom!” Nicole didn’t bat an eye. “Just saying,” she added with a knowing smirk.
Declan’s chest tightened. Soap in his mouth? Was she serious? He shot a look toward Kyle, but there was no humor in his eyes, just a quiet, resolute discipline. Kyle cleared his throat and leaned back, his expression softening just enough to show he wasn’t angry, but he wasn’t backing down either.  “Look, we get it. Hockey culture, the locker room, it’s different. We don’t mind a little edge when it's warranted, but when you're in my house, there are lines we don’t cross.” He gave Declan a pointed look, making sure the weight of the words settled. “You’re not just here to play hockey, you’re here to grow. And that means learning discipline, both on and off the ice.”
Declan couldn’t deny the way those words landed on him. His gut twisted a little, not from anger, but from something else. It wasn’t exactly comfort , but maybe that’s what he needed: boundaries.  Ryan eyed him again, his face unreadable now, like he was sizing Declan up all over again. Nicole, on the other hand, was already back to plating up another round of food, acting like nothing had happened. But Declan could tell, this family didn’t mess around. Declan let out a small exhale, unsure what to say. “Yeah, sure. Sorry about that.”  He leaned back in his chair and stared at his plate, trying to collect his thoughts. The sudden shift in atmosphere threw him off.
Kyle nodded, his voice softening again, but still carrying that same steady cadence. “It’s okay.” His mouth quirked in reassurance. “Alright. Now, eat up.” Declan met Kyle’s gaze. He nodded, offering a sheepish grin.  Ryan, still eyeing him like he’d just seen a rare species, let out a quiet sigh and turned his attention back to his food. Kyle gave Ryan a look that was all too familiar, a mix of casual suggestion and quiet command.  “Hey, after dinner why don’t you help Declan get started on his homework?” Ryan immediately groaned, his fork clattering against his plate. “I’m not a tutor.”
Kyle didn’t flinch. He just raised his eyebrows, the eyebrows, stern but patient. The kind that said: You sure about that answer, kid? Ryan deflated with a dramatic sigh, like he’d just been asked to scrub the entire rink with a toothbrush. “Dad, come on, I’ve got my own homework to finish. And I’m seriously wiped out.” He slouched even further, practically melting into his seat. Before the tension could stretch any further, Declan spoke up, casually throwing Ryan a lifeline. “It’s fine. Mrs. Burke said I could get a tutor or something to catch up. No big deal.” Kyle kept an eyebrow raised at Ryan, then looked back at Declan with a nod. “That works. We’ll talk to the school tomorrow, get someone lined up for you.”
Ryan shot Declan a look, something between surprised and quietly grateful. He didn’t say thank you, but his shoulders dropped a little, the way they do when someone realizes they’ve just been spared. Declan just shrugged, like it wasn’t a big deal.  Nicole bit back a smile. “Don’t worry about Ryan. He’s a lot more agreeable when there’s dessert on the line.” Ryan groaned once again from his seat. “You act like I’m some kind of dessert-driven gremlin.” Kyle laughed and stood, stretching. “Aren’t you?” Nicole gave Declan a conspiratorial wink. “He once folded all the laundry in the house for a slice of triple chocolate cake. Don’t let the brooding fool you.”
“I was ten.” Declan smirked. “Good to know. I’ll keep chocolate cake in mind if I ever need a favor.” The tight coil of nerves in his chest loosened just a little. The way they all moved around each other felt…safe. He hadn’t realized how much he’d missed that kind of energy. Or maybe how little he’d ever had it in the first place. After the last dish was rinsed and stacked, the clatter of plates gave way to the softer sounds of evening settling in. Kyle dried his hands on a kitchen towel and nodded toward the hallway. “C’mon, kid. Let’s get you set up.”
Nicole offered a gentle smile, already halfway up the stairs with a fresh set of linens tucked under her arm. Declan followed, duffel slung over one shoulder, the adrenaline of the day slowly giving way to exhaustion.  The guest room was just off the staircase, second door on the left. When Nicole pushed it open, Declan blinked, surprised. The room was a lot bigger than he expected. Not massive, but comfortably spacious. Soft gray walls, a queen bed with a green comforter and a real headboard, not the cinderblock-and-mattress setup he was used to. A big window overlooked the backyard, and a framed print of TD Garden hung over the dresser. A small desk sat under a shelf lined with books and picture frames. It didn’t feel like a guest room.
“Wow,” he muttered. “This is… seriously nice.” Behind him, Kyle chuckled. “Look at that. You didn’t even drop an F-bomb this time.” Declan shot him a smirk over his shoulder. “I’m learning.” Nicole grinned as she set a folded blanket at the foot of the bed. “Fast learner, too. That’s good news.” Kyle knocked gently on the door connecting to the bathroom. “You and Ryan share this. Jack and Jill setup. Two sinks, one shower. Just don’t spend an hour in there or he’ll lose it.” “Noted,” Declan said, still eyeing the space like it might vanish if he blinked.
Nicole gave the comforter one last fluff. “Let us know if you need anything. Seriously. Make yourself at home.” Kyle nodded once, giving him a brief clap on the shoulder. “Big day tomorrow, so get some rest.” Nicole lingered for a second longer, then stepped forward and wrapped Declan in a quick, warm hug. He froze for half a beat, caught off guard, before awkwardly returning it. “Good night, love,” she said softly, giving his arm a gentle squeeze before stepping back. Declan blinked, unsure what to do with the sudden warmth in his chest. No one had called him that in…well, maybe ever.
“Night,” Declan mumbled, voice low. Kyle paused at the door, gave him a look that was genuine. “We’re glad you’re here, Declan. Really.” And just like that, they left him to it. The door left slightly ajar, like a quiet sign he wasn’t on his own here. Declan stood for a moment, duffel still in hand, just taking it in. The house was quiet now, except for the faint sound of a TV down the hall and the occasional creak of floorboards. He let out a long breath, dropped his bag by the desk, and sat on the edge of the bed.  He kicked off his shoes and lay back, hands behind his head, eyes tracing the ceiling. Through the door of the Jack and Jill bathroom, he could hear faint movement; Ryan brushing his teeth maybe, or just walking around his own room.  A shared wall, a shared life, starting now. Maybe this year wouldn’t suck.
Sue Kay of Hawke's Bay, New Zealand writes: "I wish to thank all the kind people who helped my husband and me find our way from the airport to our hotel in the Sydney CBD. My husband is 90, and I'm 74 but, despite making ourselves known to our guide at the airport on arrival, we were left behind! We didn't know how to get to our hotel as we had the transfer organised. We must have asked at least six different people how to get to the Furama and everybody was so helpful and even helped us with our luggage. Sydneysiders may be big-city slickers but they have a small-town kindness!"

2 sectors lead the market. Broadcom may have another custom chip partner
Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch - an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. Market moves: Stocks were higher to start the new week, with the Dow, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq shrugging off the trade and tariff headlines that caused weakness on Wall Street last week. Energy was the top-performing sector Monday, thanks to gains in oil and natural gas prices. Our lone oil and nat gas name, Coterra Energy, was jumping roughly 3.8%. Tech, however, was the main driver of the overall market gains due to the strength in the Magnificent Seven stocks. The Club owns six of them: Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The seventh Mag 7 stock is Tesla. The only two sectors sitting out Monday's rally were health care and financials. Both sectors are among the top gainers so far this year but have come under pressure in February. All three of our financial positions - Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and BlackRock - are presenting at conferences on Tuesday. So, we'll hear the latest from each of them.
Broadcom: One of Broadcom 's new custom AI chip partnerships is coming into focus. Reuters reported Monday that ChatGPT creator OpenAI is finalizing the design for its first in-house chip. The story suggests the chip is in the later stages and could begin to be mass-produced later this year. Taiwan Semiconductor is the fab that will manufacture this new custom chip, but the story says the chip was designed by OpenAI's in-house team in collaboration with Broadcom. The Hock Tan-led Broadcom currently has three custom AI chip customers, and those clients are widely believed to be Alphabet and Meta - and most recently, ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok. When Broadcom last reported earnings in December, one of the reasons why the stock soared almost 25% was Tan's reveal that the company was in advanced AI chip development with two additional hyperscalers. Based on previous media reports, OpenAI and Apple are believed to be those two customers. Microsoft is a financial backer and partner of OpenAI. On Broadcom's December earnings call, Tan estimated the company's service addressable market (SAM) for its AI business, which includes sales of both custom and networking chips, was $60 billion to $90 billion. That bullish target did not include custom silicon sales from these two new customers. If all the reporting is true, having a fourth AI chip customer in production is great news for Broadcom's ability to capture this large SAM. Broadcom shares jumped 4.5% on Monday. But they were still below their Jan. 24 close before Chinese startup DeepSeek went viral with claims of a cheaper AI model that slammed chip stocks.
Up next: It's a quieter week of earnings. Some companies reporting after the closing bell Monday are Vertex Pharmaceutical, Lattice Semiconductor, and Astera Labs. Before the opening bell on Tuesday, Coca-Cola, Marriott, Humana, and Club name DuPont report quarterly resuts. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

South African opener Matthew Breetzke etched his name into the record books by becoming the first batter to score 150 runs on ODI debut in second match of the ongoing tri-series against New Zealand at the Gaddafi Stadium on Monday. His stunning knock of 150 off 148 balls, laced with 11 fours and five sixes, surpassed the previous record held by the legendary West Indies' batter Desmond Haynes, who scored 148 in his maiden ODI innings against Australia back in 1978. Before Breetzke's innings, the highest score on ODI debut for South Africa was 124 by Colin Ingram against Zimbabwe in 2010. Now, Breetzke stands alone at the top, delivering a performance that showcased patience, aggression, and remarkable shot selection as South Africa posted a mammoth 304/6.
Fresh off a month-long stint in the SA20 2025 season, Breetzke seamlessly transitioned into the ODI format, forming a crucial second-wicket stand of 93 runs with Jason Smith (41). He reached his half-century off 68 balls and continued to build on his solid start, eventually reaching his maiden century in 128 deliveries with the help of six boundaries and two sixes. In doing so, he became only the fourth South African to score an ODI century on debut, joining an elite club featuring Ingram, his current captain Temba Bavuma, and Reeza Hendricks.
Post-century, Breetzke punished O'Rourke with two boundaries and a six in a single over, thus accelerating South Africa's late-innings scoring and building momentum for the Proteas. While his partnership with Smith provided early stability, he went on to forge another century stand for the fourth wicket with Wiaan Mulder (64), pushing South Africa past the 300-run mark. Breetzke, who will later join the Lucknow Super Giants in IPL 2025, exhibited complete dominance at the crease, enabling South Africa to establish a formidable total and providing their bowlers with a substantial platform in their bowling defence.
This will be the year that Guinness loses its cool. Cheers to that!
I'm not sure I can remember exactly when I sensed it. Maybe it was when some of the more gimmicky London pubs introduced "stamp cards" to ration out Guinness after news of a shortage; maybe it was when I was served the 500th London Guinness rating video by my Instagram algorithm. Regardless of the precise moment the notion arrived, however, I have felt for a while that we are heading for a change when it comes to the pint du jour. For a few years now, Guinness has been the fashionable choice for millennial and gen Z drinkers, swept up in the aesthetic renaissance of the Good Old-Fashioned Bloody Pub. But I think the tide is turning. This will probably be the year that the Irish stout stops being cool.
I'm pretty sure that what will finally usher the Guinness hype train back into the station will be the same thing that came for Aperol spritzes and truffle: overexposure. The Aperol, once a genuinely trendy, vaguely Sex and the City-ish aperitivo-style drink is now a cultural behemoth in its own right - delicious, certainly, but definitely no longer "cool." And truffle, well ... would you like a side of truffle fries for that truffle mac and cheese garnished with truffle oil?
Overexposure, of course, is the death knell for cool in most cases (or at least self-conscious, trend-following "coolness," as I mean it here). This is particularly true amid the one-upmanship of contemporary food and drink culture which, as defined by social media, is always about being the first to find the undiscovered or most novel thing - the "hidden gem," the bakery and "pasta space" in London's zone 6 or what have you ("Come with me to the pub in Richmond that regularly floods"). And while Guinness's current round of popularity began because it was once viewed among younger pubgoers as a left-field choice - an "if you know, you know" order - it now couldn't be less of a secret.
Undeniably, Guinness is everywhere. For the 2024-25 season, it shafted Budweiser to become the official beer of the Premier League, and will hold this honour for the next four years. It is the official beer of rugby's Six Nations tournament (meaning that for the next month, it is also the official beer of people called Henry). And a few months ago, news broke that the brand will be opening a Guinness Storehouse attraction, described as a "microbrewery and culture hub," in Covent Garden - despite the fact that London has nothing to do with Guinness or its 250-year-old heritage. Add to this the countless Hinge prompts about "splitting the G," and the impenetrable gaggle of gilets that pretty much always surrounds Soho's Guinness Disneyland, otherwise known as the wildly successful Devonshire pub, and you have to admit that the brand's cool stock is sinking.
I don't speak as a Guinness naysayer. On the contrary, I grew up with a Dublin man and former pub landlord for a grandfather, so reverence for the stout is all but in my blood. As such, Guinness is pretty much the only pint I regularly drink, and I'll even admit that I'm One Of Those People who has long-winded opinions about their favourite Guinness in London, and who really does believe that it differs in quality depending on where you order it (it's all in the gas, the installation and the line-cleaning).
While Guinness may be at significant risk of losing its edge among, say, people who queue outside bakeries, this hardly matters to its bottom line. It has surpassed cult status, and has in essence become too big to fail. Debra Crew, chief executive of Diageo, the drinks conglomerate that owns the brand, told press this week that demand for the stout in October and November 2024 had surpassed even the amount called for during St Patrick's Day celebrations, noting that the clamour was "unprecedented." Crew also stated that Diageo is spending €200m (£170m) on a new Guinness factory in Kildare to keep supplies up to the level now required.
Music to my ears, really - I'm just pleased that while years ago you could walk into a pub and reasonably expect that Guinness wouldn't be served there, these days I can pretty much get my preferred pint anywhere. And, among all of the arguments to explain the surge in approval for the drink, it is important to acknowledge the obvious one: its smooth texture and subtly rich taste do just combine to offer something genuinely delicious, even when you get a mediocre one.
Ultimately, I'm more than happy to let the hype move on to a less obvious drink (over the past couple of weeks, I've been in two south-east London pubs that have recently installed the rival stout Murphy's, owing to local demand - go figure). Because as annoying as social media Guinness chat might be, and despite the extent to which the Schooner Scorer's camera angles haunt my nightmares (I mean it, don't Google it), it's like a wise man called Robbie Williams once sang: "You can't argue with popularity. Well you could, but you'd be wrong."
Pig Heart Boy review - lively staging of Malorie Blackman's stimulating novel
Some set designs instantly make sense. Paul Wills's clever arrangement of television screens and speakers, all linked up by glowing capillary-like tubes, encapsulates Malorie Blackman's 1997 novel about a boy whose pig-heart transplant leads to a media frenzy. Andrew Exeter's lighting switches from blood red to cool blue for scenes when 13-year-old Cameron repeatedly puts himself - and, eventually, his new heart - to the test when diving at his local pool.
Blackman's novel is itself a deep dive: this "what would you do?" book for young readers considers ethics, animal rights, othering and empathy. Keeping the pre-social media setting, Winsome Pinnock's new adaptation draws upon the heightened poetic style of Blackman's opening chapter. Pinnock retains the narrator's spirited interest in wordplay, boosts the wisdom of Cameron's Nan and makes water more of a unifying theme throughout the story. Her version also takes a thrilling new turn towards the end.
Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu's boisterous production has some vivid performances, too, including by Immanuel Yeboah in the main role. But by overplaying the comedy it drowns out some of the story's more reflective episodes. In the novel, Cameron often cracks jokes, even when face to face with the animal named Trudy whose heart he will receive, yet that encounter is hugely moving as the boy is overwhelmed with relief, fear, guilt and hope. On stage, Trudy is played as a disco-queen pig with pink puffer jacket and oversized glasses; discovering Cameron's plans for her heart, she squeals in jokey horror. Elsewhere, animal rights are thinly discussed.
The production is more successful at conveying how Cameron is viewed by his classmates both before the operation (when they see his illness as fragility) and after (when he is still considered different to them). The children are played by an adult cast, most doubling up as the grownup characters. The pioneering Dr Bryce (Tré Medley) is amusingly portrayed as a spy-like smooth operator, all dressed in white both in and out of his laboratory, when that set design again works efficiently. Christina Ngoyi as his best friend Marilyn (Marlon in the book) has the right note of compromised loyalty; Christine During's popular Julie has a buoyant ease but her later fear of Cameron again tips into comedy.
Cameron's asides to the audience include a raucous interrogation about who sold his story to the press that is strained and distracts from his inner tumult. The screens on stage could be used more effectively during Cameron's TV interview and for the camcorder footage he records for his brother.
The show is aimed at nine to 13-year-olds (probably geared more towards the younger side of that range) and dynamically captures the turbulent world of school thanks in part to DK Fashola's movement direction, especially appealing in an early slo-mo sequence. This staging has plenty of style and flows swiftly, helped by Xana's sound design and compositions - but it never has quite the same direct appeal to head and heart as Blackman's book.
If you thought Elon Musk was bad, look at his dreadful mini-mes and shudder for America
You would be forgiven for thinking we were back at the Bullingdon Club, in the company of Jonty, Munty, Stiffy, Kipper, Chugger and, to use the polite version, Pig Botherer - only in this case it's Big Balls and a guy with a history of racist tweeting. This is the sudden, startling emergence into American political life of a type deeply recognisable to Brits: that is, jaunty young men with juvenile nicknames and a firm belief they should be running the world.
This being America, the class signifiers are slightly different from those in Britain. But in most regards, the cohort of young men hired by Elon Musk for his cost-cutting taskforce, the department of government efficiency (Doge), will be familiar to anyone who lived through the era of Boris Johnson's weapons-grade flippancy or reports of David Cameron's youthful hijinks. (Donald Trump is very flippant, of course, but his style skews locker room rather than debate chamber - or, in this case, maths olympiad.) And while politics has always run on young, volunteer energy, less common in the US, perhaps, is the imperial swagger, the sheer frivolous entitlement accompanying a crowd that has seemingly been given the keys to the kingdom.
Let's look at the lineup. The youngest of Musk's Doge hires, Edward Coristine - online username, Big Balls - is a 19-year-old former intern at Neuralink, Musk's neurotechnology company, who until recently appeared to be a first-year student at Northeastern University in Boston. Luke Farritor is a 23-year-old former SpaceX intern. Marko Elez, 25, used to work for X and SpaceX, and was revealed by the Wall Street Journal to have authored several since-removed tweets asserting, among other things, "You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity." (Elez briefly resigned before Musk announced he'd reinstate him.)
And Gavin Kliger, a 25-year-old who boosted a post on X by the white supremacist Nick Fuentes, and whose newly launched Substack this week highlighted the perils of skipping freshman English 101 with a post entitled "Why DOGE: Why I gave up a seven-figure salary to save America."
Between them, these men have gained access to federal premises and staffing systems that govern agencies including USAid, the Department of Health and Human Services, the education and energy departments, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and contain sensitive information relating to millions of Americans. Elez was, reportedly, erroneously given overwrite access to the Treasury department's payment system before it was yanked back to read-only.
Of course, given that Doge has not responded to questions about what, if any, security clearance these young men have gone through, read-only is bad enough. The head of Doge, hiring in his own image, has turned to young, male software engineers with startup energy and the conviction that if you understand coding, you understand life. They've established sleeping pods in spare offices at the federal agencies they have been engaged to gut or dismantle, so that while Musk goes on X to mock federal employees for not working at weekends, his mini-mes work round the clock.
This feat would be more impressive if their online remarks and bios didn't flag what might diplomatically be called large gaps in their skill-sets. Musk, a man with the emotional maturity of a cartoon bank robber, is leading a group of men most of whom have no government or management experience whatsoever, let alone expertise in fields governed by the agencies they have been tasked to reform. The whole scene is reminiscent of the 90s boom in management consultancy, during which new graduates stared with frank disbelief at anyone who was over 35 and still breathing. And sure enough, as reported in the New York Times, young engineers have been overheard referring to federal employees as "dinosaurs," who have in turn called the guys in baseball caps "Muskrats."
On X, meanwhile, Musk amplified a post pitching "autistic tech bros" against "non-binary Deep State theater kids," and another that said what's happening in the US right now is equivalent to "the yearbook committe and theater kid types getting rocked by a football team and chess club alliance." Theatre kids and chess nerds are, traditionally, both categories of social death in high school that are targeted by queen bees and jocks, a case of Musk siding with the oppressor that's even sadder when you consider that Trump isn't even a real jock. (For a full account of Trump's hilariously mediocre sports career relative to his claims about it, read Lucky Loser by Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig.)
Anyway, we know how this ends. In the largest sense, with the cancellation of programmes mandated democratically in Congress by a bunch of unelected goons in puffer vests. And in the smallest sense, with one of these 22-year-old jerks spilling his Big Gulp cup of Mountain Dew over a keyboard at the Treasury and wiping the social security data of 70 million Americans. I look forward to watching as Big Balls and co find new ways to tank an economy even more efficiently and irreversibly than Brexit.
A tale of two suckers: Donald Trump's plastic straws and Keir Starmer
It's difficult to know whether to set any store by Donald Trump's bleak and yet also often banal pronouncements, which read as if handfuls of offensive concepts have been tossed into the air by a monkey, read out in whatever order they landed and then made policy. Until it's clear they can't work. At which point, the monkey must toss again.
But this month, Trump, whose morning ablutions increasingly appear to consist of dousing himself in sachets of the kind of cheap hot chocolate powder I steal from three-star hotels, like a flightless bird stuck in the machine that glazes Magnum lollies, declared he wanted to build his hotels on the mass graves of Gaza. Hasn't Trump seen The Shining? It won't end well. Pity those whose children have the misfortune to die next to a monetisable stretch of shoreline. And hope humanity's next wave of mass killings happens somewhere uneven and way inland that hopefully wouldn't even make a decent golf course.
Is Ukraine the frontier upon which the future of European democracy hinges, or is it just a massive stretch of undeveloped fairway, its leisure/conference utility value currently compromised only by the desire of some losers to continue living in the country they consider home? Where we see the falling domino chain that starts with Poland and ends in your back garden, does Trump see only a succession of 18-hole courses full of men in caps and enormous flapping flares brokering manly deals at the tee? Drive your golf carts over the bones of the dead!
But maybe Trump's horrible mouth-cack is just continuing evidence of his former acolyte Steve Bannon's advice to "flood the zone with shit"? Does Trump really hate all sea creatures so much that he has to reinstate the plastic straws Joe Biden successfully, and commendably, outlawed? Perhaps he was once told to keep his hands to himself by a mermaid. "These things don't work," Trump said of paper straws. "I've had them many times, and on occasion, they break, they explode." Must millions of seabirds, turtles, manatees and dolphins die because Trump imagines that paper straws explode? Or so he can suck up his Diet Coke fast enough to amuse Elon Musk, Pete Hegseth and JD Vance by burping a smelly chorus of YMCA in Biden's face next time there's a gathering of ex-presidents.
Like some kind of infantilised diaper king, Trump has genuinely had a special Diet Coke-summoning button installed in the Oval Office
Because Trump, a fully grown man with unlimited funds, loves Diet Coke, and it's tempting to wonder how many of his seemingly incomprehensible policy decisions can be traced back to his desire to be continually saturated by the soft drink. Maybe there is a subterranean lake of the stuff somewhere deep beneath the Greenland tundra that the climate crisis, which doesn't exist, will soon make accessible to Trump's deep Diet Coke drills? Delighted Inuit strip off their sealskins and dance in the showering liquid as they realise they have just struck a rich seam of their new master's black gold. Like some kind of infantilised diaper king, Trump has genuinely had a special Diet Coke-summoning button installed in the Oval Office. Hopefully, he won't get it mixed up with that other button. It will be a shame if all life on Earth is fatally irradiated just because Trump wanted a 500ml bucket of fizz to swill down his Big Mac and fries.
But are we meant to take Trump's erratic announcements seriously? While the last concerned voices of the dying liberal press pen outraged articles to their dying liberal readers about Gaza hotels, the invasion of Canada and Trump making it compulsory to drink everything through a Trump Plastic Freedom Straw Company Deluxe Plastic Freedom Straw ™ ®, even cauliflower cheese soup, his homunculus Musk has been quietly dismantling the infrastructure of American government as you knew it. There are cup-and-ball tricksters on Parisian street corners with more subtle moves.
Half a dozen of Musk's own hand-harvested incels-in-waiting, the kind of people who under normal circumstances would have got rich by inventing a way in which hardcore digital pornography could have been mainlined directly into the bloodstream in liquid form, have, under the spurious authority of Musk's imaginary "department of government efficiency," gone in and stolen all the data about everyone and everything in the US ever. Never mind. I am sure they will use it responsibly. What can possibly go wrong?
Some people gathered at the scenes of Musk's cost-cutting exercises and waved placards. Others sat and gawked at news footage of Kanye West's naked wife's arse or enjoyed disappointing trailers for the new Captain America movie, while the world as they knew it crumbled beneath their king-sized sofas. Keir Starmer backed away, as one might from a neighbour's unpredictable weapon dog, avoiding direct comment, dodging a commitment to the AI declaration like a coward and hoping for the best, while Trumpy growls and foams. Which simply won't do.
Look. I'm as disappointed as the next metropolitan liberal elitist champagne socialist by Starmer's government. While I accept, for example, the migration crisis must be addressed, I didn't expect Starmer, who once left his "village and went to the city of Leeds" and "discovered a whole new world of indie bands - like Orange Juice and the Wedding Present," to do it with Nigel Farage-style performative cruelty. Address the migration crisis, by all means, but don't be a c*** about it. Did Orange Juice suffer the indignity of their eponymous third album not even entering the top 50 in 1984 just so, 41 years later, Starmer could send Yvette Cooper out to downgrade the desperate, like Paul Golding in heels.
Currently, as Putin puffs up under Trump's protection and unregulated AI threatens to rewrite history in real time, Starmer is on his knees sucking the paper straw of Trump's presidency. I fear it may be about to explode in his mouth.
Meghan's rebranded herself - and it's another valiant attempt to flog poshness to the little people
In these days of darkness we must take delight where we can find it, and one reliable source is the Duchess of Sussex. In her latest venture, Meghan, who occupies the tricky position of having a large platform and not enough to fill it (see also: Brooklyn Beckham), launched a new lifestyle brand that, she promised in a short video, would be "beautifully weaving together everything I cherish - food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living and finding joy in the everyday." The brand American Riviera Orchard is dead. Long live the new brand, As Ever.
The duchess and her husband, Prince Harry, have to do something and good luck to them, but it's hard not to study the rollout of As Ever for signs of the widening gap between Meghan's self-image and how the rest of the world sees her. ""As ever,"" writes the duchess on Instagram, "means "as it's always been" or some even say "in the same way as always,"" the "some" in this sentence apparently referring to the dictionary definition of a two-word phrase that no one has ever had trouble understanding.
It's ridiculous, of course, as is the hello-little-people tone adopted by the former royal highness, in keeping with the general attitude of the famous towards the unfamous - namely, one of stating the bleeding obvious as though sharing the key to existence. Still, I find myself sympathising with Meghan, who in her Instagram post and its accompanying video faces the stark challenge of having to pad out thin material. "This is what I do," she says to camera, "and I haven't been able to share it with you for the past few years, but now I can." What is the "it" here, and what has stopped her from sharing it? (It may involve jam, as did her previous brand, which she launched by sending "limited edition" jars of preserve to, among others, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Tracee Ellis Ross, who apparently also got a fresh bag of lemons.) Anyway, whatever the content, she hints darkly at some "whispers" abroad that forced her to jump the gun and share news of As Ever before she was ready - because "I wanted you to hear it from me first."
The fact there is no story here makes Meghan's insistence that she is getting in front of the story all the more enjoyable, but the more curious aspect of the announcement is the "you" to whom she refers and the idea she clearly has of her audience. The celebrity lifestyle space is crowded, ferocious and notoriously fickle, littered with the carcasses of former brand leaders such as Chrissy Teigen. Target and Bloomingdales distanced themselves from the star around the same time as she was accused of, and later apologised for, cyberbullying a woman called Courtney. The space is also dominated by market leaders such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Rachel Zoe.
Meghan is a minnow in these waters, but of course has her own secret weapon she isn't shy about using. In the new video, she deploys good old Harry to hold up the cameraphone and drop a few posh tones - "Is this thing on?" - to remind us that, even if As Ever isn't royal, exactly, it is at least royal adjacent. The new name is clearly a reach for something classier and more timeless than its predecessor, American Riviera Orchard, which sounded like a range of scented gift baskets you'd find at a discount shopping outlet, or the pair's charity arm, Archewell, a play on their son's name. Both brands have an aspirant lower middle-class vibe about them, which it would be rude to point out were it not for the fact that Harry and Meghan trade on class as part of their branding.
What they are selling isn't poshness itself, which strictly speaking should entail low-comfort, hole-in-the-elbows, bad cooking and draughty houses, but - much like Trump and his performance of "billionaire" - a kind of ersatz poshness they imagine might appeal to the peasants. It's a hard one to get right and, with the new brand name, Meghan seems to have changed course in the direction of, say, a Calvin Klein perfume or something a bit more abstract and upmarket. Although for my money she was on to more of a winner with the obscure and personalised brand name The Tig, her first attempt at lifestyle content that had to be shelved when she started dating Harry. As she explained at the time, The Tig was derived from an abbreviation of her favourite wine, tignanello, and had about it the confidence of something genuinely felt rather than a brand name that has been kicked through a comms team.
Which brings us to the duchess's understanding of audience. Discounting the forfeiture of sympathy that comes with money and privilege, there is something akin to pathos in the video that I find painful to watch. Meghan's aw-shucks, I-know-you-love-me tone assumes not only goodwill but abject fandom on the part of an audience which, I suspect, is at least 50% made up of those who regard her not only critically but with downright derision. It is hard to witness. "Sending lots of love," she signs off with noblesse oblige and an almost charming dedication to what she imagines we think of her.
I am a tweakment holdout. When will wrinkles, bad teeth and big pores be back in fashion? Totally neutral question, no right or wrong answer: how do you feel about salmon sperm?
It's not a Nordic culinary microtrend or a sex thing, but a beauty treatment, in which "Polydeoxyribonucleotides (PDRN) derived from purified fragments of DNA extracted from yes, "salmon sperm"" are injected into your face. It does seem to work: proper research has found PDRN has wound-repairing properties in hard-to-treat contexts such as diabetic ulcers and deep burns. Good news (unless you're a male salmon). But what is it doing in healthy faces?
I learned about salmon sperm in a Sunday Times article on the "skincare secrets" of "26 tastemakers," which I read, increasingly aghast. It was a litany of lasers, microneedling, injectables and proprietary treatments with silly names that left me shouting crossly at my laptop: "But what does it do?" The only treatment I related to at all was Marina Abramović recounting how a friend of her mother's put hot mashed potato on her face to temporarily erase wrinkles; Abramović herself uses "thermage radiofrequency." No wonder a salmon sperm practitioner says it's "an exciting time in the aesthetic industry."
Some contributors were celebs, regularly running the unforgiving gauntlet of high-definition television, and the rest were at least very interested, if not professionally involved, in beauty, so they probably aren't typical. And there's a certain honesty to it, at least. No one is making out their dewy glow is "just good genes" and "loads of water." But I also think this newfound willingness to talk about "tweakments" (a jaunty portmanteau that makes me queasy) is a product of them being absolutely everywhere.
Because they are everywhere, for everyone. According to researchers at University College London, the UK injectables market will be worth £11.7bn by next year, with Botox and fillers available anywhere from Harley Street to high-street hairdressers. Writing in Grazia last week, the Guardian beauty columnist Sali Hughes described how "women in teaching, policing and the civil service" ask her advice on where to get "good injections." In the US, Botox use by 20- to 29-year-olds has increased 28% since 2010, with gen Z buying into "prejuvenation" (another awful portmanteau), fuelled by the poreless perfection offered by filters, staring at themselves on pandemic screens and social media skinfluencers (argh).
I shouldn't be surprised - actual children are buying expensive anti-ageing potions and fretting about their nonexistent crow's feet now. But still, this dramatic normalisation of invasive beauty procedures is unnerving.
For one thing, tweakments are so expensive! It's none of my business how people spend their money - my disposable income is dedicated to becoming the Joe Exotic of decorative poultry - but will we end up with an attractiveness inequality gap? Or will the democratisation of HD face mean almost everyone will be smoothly immobile soon? I suspect there will always be better and worse tweakments: that UCL research also points out how alarmingly unregulated the industry is.
It's also uncomfortable feeling so out of step. My only foray into tweakment territory is getting my brows, lost to alopecia, tattooed back on (which demonstrates how central frowning is to my character, so Botox is out). It's not that I'm smugly delighted with my 50-year-old face: the baleful crone in my new passport photo appears, inexplicably, to have a single black eye (actually just a dark circle), adding to the "pensioner arrested after brawl outside bookies" vibe. It would be nice to feel better about my neck, but not nice enough to actually do anything painful and expensive about it.
I suppose we tweakment holdouts will have to wait, and hope, for the tide to turn. As Ozempic and shiny veneers may make thinness and Hollywood teeth look boring and basic, perhaps perfect faces will fall from fashion? I mention the veneers, because when I was watching the Bridget Jones movie, I become fascinated by Chiwetel Ejiofor's teeth. They're absolutely lovely, yes, but sort of ... normal? One lower one peeps out from slightly behind the others. It only added to his charm. Hugh Grant's 64-year-old face looked charismatically crumpled too. Maybe when everyone has been homogenised to a glazed sheen of perfection, sagging, bumps, gaping pores and rough patches will be the height of desirability. At that point, I'll be ready for my closeup.
Trump's bullshit blitz has Europe on its knees
Was it really only a month ago that the pole-dancer patron, fridge explorer, Brexit get-doer, model bus maker, sofa-strainer, wall-spaffer, current Daily Mail columnist and former British prime minister Boris Johnson eulogised the inauguration of Donald Trump in the Mail, recounting how, as the "invisible pulse of power surged" from the battered bible into the hand of Trump: "I saw the moment the world's wokerati had worked so hard to prevent."
I hope Johnson is pleased with the way things have worked out. Because now the foolish wokerati have been schooled beyond Johnson's wettest dreams. It's the Trump-Putin-bin Salman party! An adjudicated sex offender and convicted fraudster, and a man who sanctioned a chemical warfare hit, killing a British citizen on British soil, have met at the luxury Saudia Arabian hotel of another man, who, according to the US, reportedly approved the murder and subsequent dismemberment of a journalist, to discuss the similarly brutal dismemberment of Ukraine, without consulting either Ukraine itself or the countries most directly affected by the legitimisation of Putin's territorial anxieties. Don't worry, Poland! Stable genius Trump has got this covered, so break out the bone saws, pop the cork on the novichok and grab the girls by the pussy! There are 1970s Italian slasher films with less gruesome plotlines. Well said, Boris Johnson! That's certainly stuck it to the wokerati!
If only Johnson, and Trump's other cheerleaders in the rightwing press and on the right of the house, could be brave enough to call out Trump for what he is. If only Johnson had the moral courage of Ed Davey from the Liberal Democrats. In what newly warped reality does that sentence even exist? But, on balance, the whitewashing of the deaths of tens of thousands of Ukrainians is a small price to pay for the delight Trump has bought to the smiling faces of people who hate the transgender community, wild swimming enthusiasts and Guardian readers. Sniffing mineral rights in the air, like the smell of napalm in the morning, Trump has grabbed Ukraine by the pussy and he ain't gonna let go. Trump is, unequivocally, the worst thing to happen to human civilisation since Hitler. And Ricky Gervais's After Life.
European politicians more rational and less self-serving than Johnson are trying to formulate the correct response to Trump's rapid and reckless redrawing of the postwar world disorder in his own, and Russia's, interests. The correct response is to shit your pants. On Tuesday, Trump even blamed Ukraine itself for being invaded, which is a bit like blaming E Jean Carroll herself for being sexually abused in a department store changing room. Couldn't she have cut a pre-emptive deal before things escalated? Victims! Always blaming someone else. But Trump has put the idea that the invasion of Ukraine is Ukraine's fault out there now, on the world stage, amplified by his collaborators in the tech bro media, and it will gradually calcify into one of those persistent alternative facts. By Wednesday he'd called Zelenskyy a dictator (and a mediocre comedian, which in my opinion is even worse).
Think what Hitler could have achieved if he'd had Twitter, currently X, and Google at his disposal
And it's that kind of reshaping of reality that needs a coherent European response. Recently, the US vice-president, JD Vance, who has the exact same face-beard as the main male oppressor in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid's Tale, came and told the Munich security conference that Scotland had made it illegal to pray silently in your own home. Many things are illegal in Scotland. Fruit, for example, and cushions, which are deemed too soft by the Scottish Cushion Committee. But not silent private prayer. Largely ignoring dead-in-the-water Ukraine, Vance also told Europe we had some kind of moral duty to allow unchecked, factually inaccurate bullshit to clog our infosphere via Trump's tech bro acolytes" social media platforms, his inflammatory comments about illegal Scottish prayer in the same speech proving exactly why such regulation is required. And I think he knows this.
Predictably, Vancewas one of the three main early investors in Rumble, the social media site for all the people whose conspiratorial untruths and borderline criminality make them too toxic for other social media sites - Russell Brand, Alex Jones and Darth Vader etc - so he personally stood to profit from this sort of popularisation of inflammatory actionable crap. As did fellow Rumble original main investor Peter Thiel, the man behind Palantir, the big tech company Wriggling Wes Streeting is keen to hand all our NHS data to, revealing an interlocking and endless web of bad influence that only "cat woman" Carole Cadwalladr had the persistence of vision to apprehend, and she's currently shunting off to a subscription Substack site, a crowdfunded Cassandra in an era busy eating its own brainstem.
For a brief period around teatime on Monday, Keir Starmer, who once left his "village and went to the city of Leeds" and "discovered a whole new world of indie bands - like Orange Juice and the Wedding Present" delusionally imagined he could be some kind of go-between twixt observable reality and Trump. But did West Yorkshire jangle-pop pioneers the Wedding Present radically retool their signature sound for 1991"s Seamonsters album just so Starmer could become a Neville Chamberlain for the cover-mounted fanzine flexidisc generation?
We have staved off outright fascism throughout most of Europe pretty well for 80 years now, but outright fascism in Europe was never quite so well funded and promoted as it is now, since the US government and the social media platforms that do its bidding decided backing outright fascism was a good way to smash the EU. Think what Hitler could have achieved if he'd had Twitter, currently X, and Google at his disposal. He wouldn't have needed the V2 rocket, Lord Haw-Haw and Hugo Boss. He could have razed half of Europe with a Hulk Hogan meme, some persuasive online misinformation and a dozen jauntily askew baseball caps.
Musk's Threats Darken as MAGA Rages at Fresh Legal Losses
If we get a court ruling saying that some of those firings are illegal, they'll say, We're not going to listen, we're going to keep firing. In a sense, they fired the watchdogs of waste, fraud, and abuse across the government, Trump did. The inspectors general, independent people in the agencies, Greg, [who] were there to watch Trump's wrongdoing. He had a Friday night massacre, wiped them out. He broke the law - you're supposed to give 30-day notice, you're supposed to give a reason.
That's a test. So far, there hasn't been litigation. Trump is waving the red flag. He wants to assert that absolute power. If there's a court order, that is the place where I expect Trump and Musk to say [something like] The Treasure of the Sierra Madre's "We don't care about no stinking badges," We don't care about no stinking court orders, this is my constitutional right. Article 3, that's the judiciary; Article 2, the President; Article 1, Congress. That's a place where Trump will say, Article 1, you got no business, Article 3, you got no business, this is my power. And out of all this mess, that's the single place where the Supreme Court might be most likely to take him seriously.
I think a lot of the other stuff is such a flagrant violation. These 40 cases.... It's like an advent calendar of illegality, Greg. Every day you turn up another flap and another constitutional provision statute or regulation is violated, started on day one. Many of these are dead losers for Trump, except with complicit, corrupt, conflicted Thomas and Alito.
Musk's Threats Suddenly Darken as Trump Legal Losses Trigger MAGA Fury
Rage is mounting among President Donald Trump's allies over the losses that Trump's agenda has suffered in court, which are clearly becoming a serious obstacle to him. It's gotten so bad that Elon Musk shared a tweet from someone who suggested that it may be time to defy the courts. Musk also boosted Trump allies who are seething over these rulings. All that amounts to a pretty dark threat from Musk: He and MAGA appear to be steeling themselves to defy judicial rulings. We talked to Norman Eisen of Democracy Defenders Action, who is litigating against Trump, about how successful the legal resistance has been thus far, whether Trump and his allies will defy the courts, and what would happen if they did. Listen to this episode here. A transcript is here.
When Remaking a Masterpiece Is Worth the Risk
I've always thought that one of the most insoluble aesthetic problems going is remaking a movie masterpiece. I certainly understand the impulse to passionately re-engage such a work, but if the definition of a masterwork is something peerless at what it sought to accomplish, how do you remake it without simply reiterating it? There's a reason no one has tried second versions of Fellini's "8½" or Coppola's "The Godfather" or Polanski's "Chinatown." In the case of Fellini's achievement, is someone going to produce a more harrowing portrait of the self-deluding toxicity of male narcissism? In the case of Coppola's, of the corrosive effects of power? Or in the case of Polanski's, of the Hey-nothing-personal malevolence of late-model capitalism? (Water itself in that movie turns out to be the commodity that's manipulated for profit.)
When it comes to those who have waded into that kind of deep water, some have tried the Let's-really-shake-things-up solution. There's the lamentable 1962 remake of "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," for instance, which not only eliminated the central figure of Cesare the somnambulist but also featured a Caligari who instead of practicing diabolic hypnotism spent his time showing the heroine offensive pictures. Other filmmakers have chosen the even more baffling route of changing almost nothing, such as Gus Van Sant's nearly shot-for-shot 1998 remake of "Psycho." The number of disappointed moviegoers you risk in remaking a masterpiece from 1922 is smaller, for obvious reasons, but even so, the director Robert Eggers has made clear in any number of interviews his understanding that his new "Nosferatu" is re-engaging one of the greatest of the silent movies. (In 2016, when he was first attempting to remake the film, he told an interviewer that it felt "ugly and blasphemous and egomaniacal and disgusting" to take up that project so early into his career.)
F. W. Murnau's "Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror" is itself a remake - an unauthorized adaptation of "Dracula," Bram Stoker's compulsively readable fever dream of a novel - and Murnau and the screenwriter Henrik Galeen retained much of what was arresting about the original while slipping in their own major changes: They're responsible, for example, for the now-set-in-stone tradition that sunlight can destroy the vampire, a notion nowhere in Stoker's book. I likely saw "Nosferatu" at too impressionable an age. I was 6, PBS was showing such things and my babysitter was simply glad I wasn't burning down the house. But I would have been flattened by it whenever I saw it. It was like having felt a draft from a grave. (Its effects were so long-lasting that 30-something years later I published a novel inspired by the film and its production.) The whole thing wasn't so much petrifying as insidiously unsettling, and all of that started with the figure of Nosferatu himself. Max Schreck's performance is, 102 years later, still the benchmark for sinister and dignified repulsiveness. Schreck's vampire has the stillness of a figure in a bad dream or a spider on its web, and the world he inhabits is at times equally disconcerting. After our hero Hutter's first frightening night in Nosferatu's castle, he notices in the mirror that something has bitten his neck, and he smiles.
But the most destabilizing figure might well be Hutter's wife, Ellen, our heroine, who's again and again shown to be telepathically on the monster's wavelength, even when he's thousands of miles away, so that polarities like good and evil or desire and repulsion seem to just evaporate while we watch. That last aspect alone would seem to land this story in Robert Eggers's wheelhouse. Part of the subversive energy of movies like "The Witch," "The Lighthouse" and "The Northman" derives from what feels like modern takes on historical characters in thrall to dark passions so that the distantly historical is both granted its strangeness and animated by a scrutinizing modern sensibility. At its best, his version both evokes and reconceives Murnau's most brilliant visual ideas. Murnau's masterful use of the opacities of dark archways from which the vampire can emerge and into which he can dissolve is both echoed and made new. Murnau's famously arresting use of shadows to visualize the vampire's defiling reach is reimagined when those shadows in this new version extend themselves in a 360-degree pan that evokes their vertiginous inescapability. And the shadow of the vampire's hand now extends across the entire city, repurposing the most memorable image from Murnau's "Faust."
How the "Manosphere" Became Mainstream Entertainment
Whenever Bill Belichick, the 72-year-old former head coach of the New England Patriots, goes out in public with his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, who is exactly one-third his age, they tend to draw attention. It was no different at the 2025 N.F.L. Honors earlier this month. Everything about the red-carpet photos accentuates their Evel Knievel-size age gap: Belichick looks sedately pleased in a maroon blazer, like a car dealer at a Shriners banquet; Hudson beams in a sparkly Cirque du Soleil-style number that covers approximately 12 percent of her torso. That's what most people seemed to notice about the pictures.
But not Dave Portnoy. The founder and owner of Barstool Sports - the Utne Reader for the light-domestic-swilling, backslapping, Zyn-packing, parlay-chasing American male - Portnoy has long been treated as an avatar for everything that elite media is not. Barstool might be considered the outermost ring of the so-called manosphere, the vast realm of male-oriented alternative media that has been credited with the rightward drift of the young male vote. Portnoy - a Trump supporter with a long history of misogynistic comments and bullying, who has been accused of nonconsensually filming women during uncomfortably rough sex - doesn't exactly run away from that label. (He has denied the claims about sexual misconduct and filed a suit against the outlet that published them; it was dismissed.) And what he noticed about the photos of Belichick and Hudson was the clutch Hudson wore, which was shaped like a little football: "Very cool purse from BB's girlfriend," he posted on X. "Football girlfriend purse."
It's certainly possible that Portnoy, a die-hard Patriots fan, was being ironic, conveying something like, "I refuse to see anything unusual here." But I would bet that he genuinely did like the purse. I would make that bet because I have spent many hours watching Portnoy's most fascinating nonsports media product, his "One Bite" pizza reviews, and I know about his softer side. He has been doing these reviews for 12 years, though I first encountered them during the pandemic. I was, at that point, ambiently aware of Portnoy, but only for all the stuff people hated about his website: the "Smokeshow of the Day" photos, the army of online "Stoolies" who mobbed his many critics. But if you watch the pizza videos, you're reminded that most of the stuff these controversial media figures do is entirely normal. A lot of the time, it's downright amusing.
Each episode of "One Bite" begins with Portnoy's walking out the door of the business under consideration, then executing the entirety of his review right out front, sometimes practically blocking foot traffic, often with the proprietor looking on anxiously. Given all this, the concept seems almost cruel: He buys an entire pie but reviews the pizza based on one bite. "One bite," goes the motto. "Everybody knows the rules." The reason for this, Portnoy explained in an early video, is that the response has to be immediate, beneath the level of consciousness, like a "Rotchbloch" test. But Portnoy can never limit himself to one bite, typically finishing about half a slice of molten pizza, blowing big cheekfuls of air on it the way you would for a toddler, balancing the rest of the pie in his other hand as he tries to sort out where it belongs on his 10-point scale.
A fine night to start sipping into my Japan stash A wee punch with this #Rum Lush full on sugar cane fragrant and full in the mouth 💖
Another fine evening (ok not really, it's wet and drizzly, but →) to continue exploring my stash of #Rum from #Japan  Cor Cor again - this time the "Industrial" (アンデユストリエル) red version - which is the one they make from the molasses byproduct of sugar making (as opposed to the previous 'green' agricole that's directly from fermenting the cane juice).  Just got a small bottle. Quite thick, heavy sugar nose (almost probitas like), but not too sweet. Dreamy daiquiri if you ask me.
Adding to this thread on my #Japanese #Okinawa #Rum exploration Opened this OneRum bottle intending to daiquiri, but the fragrance or lack prompted me to pull out and get nosy. Smells a bit like Indian palm toddy. Uses sugar just from Ie island. Tempted to say Clairin like but no it's more spirit, vodka or sochu like - thin, smooth with a touch of heat (48%) just a late hint it's sugar distillate. Sochu, awamori sensibilities in making it for sure. (Mizuho Distillery) 1/3
2/3 This Ie Island #rum is from the Single island series. It was the only one I could get - besides the all island blend bottle, in my too brief ¾ day in #Naha #Okinawa  Here's their webpage on this rum (translated) https://onerum-jp.translate.goog/produ... Orig: https://onerum.jp/product/ie-island-ru... Do look up their about page too.
3/3 Ok so I did make that #Daiquiri   2 oz #rum 1 oz fresh squeezed lime juice [wish I had shikuwasa] ¾ oz rich simple syrup Oh dear f$expletive deleted me - in a well chilled coupe, took a sip and this is exquisite. Close my eyes and aware of the back of my neck calming.  Didn't expect that. 180⁰ from a more upfront sugary rum.
Bedtime story time! What’s up with T9 keyboards? Why do 7 and 9 have 4 letters, but others 3. Why those two? Why not assign 1 some letters? Is 0 always been space?
First of all, lemme make things worse, the Nokia 2110 ignores all your alphabets and decides oqz get their own button. But 1 is still empty!
With SMS use of these keys being first used on this nokia 2110* why do we have these on telephones? Thank the US! In the 1950s the Bell network replaced operators by automation, “connect me to texas” became 839, eight.. thr… what…  Okay Bell had an issue numbers! We have 9 numbers we can assign letters to to make routing easier. 26 letters 8 keys. 0 is a no go, special use. 1… aaand here we go! (* officially, nokias history is incorrect don’t correct me)
Why is even on the iPhone 1 an empty key? Why did USA get +1? The old Bell network had 1 reserved as a shortcut to the long distance network! So if a town started with the letters ABC you’d… yes automatically get onto the long distance network, at a heavy charge. Thus this separation!
So here we go at Bell again, the English alphabethas 26 letters, we have 8 keys. That is 3 and something per key…  Which letters do we drop. We need to drop two! Z was the last letter to enter the company thus first to go! The letter after that is Y… now that is a popular letter in place names, new York anyone? We cannot fire a letter with a perfect track record!
Language experts were hired to eliminate one more letter from the alphabet. Q (sorry Q not personal) is a special letter, every French person knows Q cannot live without U. So either one had to go.  Q in the English language has less to do than U, and Q was dropped from the Bell exchange name scheme! And this kids is why you won’t find it on old telephones.
Back to T9. SMS was a cool new invention in the GSM standard, because providers needed text transmissions anyway why not open it for a quick chat at 15 cents per 160 characters (ascii that is my friends)
As I said a few months ago [boing.world], the estate offered me a garage meaning I finally have somewhere to put a van that I can convert into a microcamper. So I bought this Berlingo last month. I thought the fact it was already converted into a van would probably make the camper-conversion easier. Turns out that's likely not really the case. So it goes. It's previously been converted for a wheelchair ramp, which means the floor has been lowered, and this means there's nowhere safe to bolt rear passenger seats, and so can't have that "rock and roll" bed, that converts into seatbelted seats for passengers. It does add a large underfloor storage area though. I thought it would be fairly easy to remove the metal plates over the windows, but that turned out to be a mistaken assumption too. Was no metal plates. They'd just painted over the glass with some metallic paint. Luckily this can be just scraped off, presumably with some paint dissolving solvents applied too. Dunno. I let the professionals handle that.
The folks that can do an actually good job of converting it into a microcamper are busy till July, so I get to play at doing a half arsed job to tide it over until then. First job is taking out the floor to gain access to that underfloor area and to cover that in linoleum. Had some lying around after they did the bathroom last year. Then to refit the floor and cover all that in a red felt carpet. The job is shoddy here really. What's needed is to insulate the entire body of the car and then cover professionally and well, but I dunno how to do all that. I just used spray glue to fasten this stretch carpet to the existing wood, that'll be replaced when it's converted proper anyway. The roof will remain cold and metal till then.
This chair works very well in the van. Should ideally be fastened better to the floor, but it has a nice three mode positions. Seating, and chaise-long, and flat as a bed with the passenger seat folded down.
You can get a folding leaf table, and if you saw off the bottom 15cm or so of the panels forming the sides and front of the table, and also don't bother to attach any of the the back leaf, then it becomes just the right height to mostly fit under the rear window. It's a little higher than the camper-fridge, but the camper fridge is pretty much the same height as a little bedside cabinet. There's also a small rectangular sink that fits nicely around the same width as the fridge alongside that cut down table. And thus, the interior can be mostly constructed in my flat. The kids in the flat upstairs kept waving as me as I was doing a terrible job of cutting down those panels with a jigsaw in the yard.
Then there's a whole day of carrying those things out to the van and trying to screw them into the floor. Had to swap the fridge and the cabinet around from the plan. The fridge is less deep than it is wide and doesn't block the table-leaf when it's at the edge with door facing the front of the car. I expected to have to pause here and measure up and buy some wood, but someone had thrown out a desk that matches very well and a bit more sawing managed to get that into the right shape to build a frame to hold everything in place. That sink is attached by only one of the six grips that are supposed to hold it. Two can't be used flat against a wooden board, and 3 aren't against anything at all right now. Maybe I can get to attach better when the pump and tap arrive.
I like the easy access to battery and water and things from the back. Fair amount of storage there too which is accessible from inside if the table is up. Still need to put the water pump into the water cannister, and power it, and attach some sort of tap to it.
And that's about as good a job as I can do really. Hopefully some of it will still be useable in a few months when it's done properly by a professional. At least the fridge ought to carry over. The bed folding down past the passenger seat is great. I'm too talk for this van really, but that makes it workable. Shame the seat/bed has to be so narrow though. The two-seater was very temping and feels like it ought to just about fit but, wouldn't really be any way to unfold it from within the van and the steering wheel gets in the way for folding the driving seat down like the passenger seat does so couldn't really go flat without also lifting up.
Thank goodness for Blender! Not sure I could have planned all that and had any hope of it all working out if I couldn't do it in virtual 3d first. 3 frames to show the 3 main configurations. Sit, Desk, and Sleep.
Game 9 of #UniversityChallenge was a hell of a match. Oriel Oxford (530 students) vs Durham (20,000), and Oriel won, which surprised me after some mistakes they made. The captain didn't know Wittengstein's name!? Possibly just nerves. Durham was ahead, then it was tied at 170, then they dropped to 165. A pity. I was rooting for them. Great team, with all four strong, so I hope they make the cut.
Game 10 of #UniversityChallenge had a great performance by Christ's Cambridge, who have a consultative captain, a good team, and a strong member named Bethlehem, so Roger Tilling called out "Christ's Bethlehem!" Exeter Oxford never got hold of much, and are out of the running. I could see Christ's Cambridge quietly going far in this series.  Some nice math questions, a picture round connected to food, and a tricky flag question. Good game.
Game 11 of #UniversityChallenge was St Andrews (granted university status by an antipope!) vs Cardiff. First round is nearing its end. Some good questions, including mentions of roll-on roll-of ferries, Agnes Martin, and Stax Records. Cardiff Tarsala will never forget her Booker T bloomer, I'm afraid. Nice quizzing from both teams, though it only really got cracking in the last few minutes.
Game 12 of #UniversityChallenge was Leeds vs Edinburgh. Leeds took a long time to get going, then had a surge in the middle but couldn't keep it going. Seemed like a number of film questions this time, and I was glad to hear PEI as an answer; no flags, though it seems like they crop up every time. Edinburgh Myles is a good captain and the whole team is strong and works well together. I think they'll do well.
#UniversityChallenge game 13 was a curious one, with Leicester being jokey, wasting time and never getting going, while the LSE captain would often turn to the farthest player for an answer, which was not infrequently wrong. Still, LSE cleaned up. I liked the blues bonus round, though sadly Leicester got none. Canadian mentions: WL Mackenzie King and Margaret Atwood. The best part was Roger Tilling saying "Leicester Lister!"
Game 14 of #UniversityChallenge was top-notch stuff, solid quizzing, down to business, fast answers, good knowledge, close ending. It seems we'll see both SOAS London and St. Edmund Hall Oxford again, because the loser makes the repechage. Very close at the finish, down to "Naples" and "pollen." An unassumingly great game.
Game 15 of #UniversityChallenge is the first of two in the repechage, where the four highest-scoring losing teams try to make it through. This week was UCL and St. Andrews, in a good-natured cheery match. Very strong play from UCL, who have a solid team, and UCL Mandel was in top form. Good questions, some tough, such as requiring "panthera" specifically or knowing "day" in Russian.
Just got to game 16 of #UniversityChallenge today, a week late, and it was a nail-biter! Really fast work at the end, with Durham coming from behind in the last few minutes to catch SOAS London in a tie in the final seconds. It went to a starter question that I got on the first clue (being an SF reader I knew "slipstream") but neither team knew. Second question and SOAS London Lambert guessed alpaca but it was llama, so Durham won. Phew, what a finish. 😰
Game 17 of #UniversityChallenge is the first of eight knockout games in the second round. This was UCL and LSE, and UCL gave an outstanding performance: very fast buzzing, good teamwork, wide general knowledge from them all (UCL Mandel notable again); they took off at the start and never slowed. Very impressive.
Game 18 of #UniversityChallenge was Durham vs Open University. I was rooting for Durham, who have a great team, but in the end to my surprise Open took it, after a number of rather slow answers. I was glad Durham got Marcel Duchamp right on one question; too bad no one knew Yoko Ono as a Fluxus artist. Much respect for Durham Nash, especially on bird silhouettes and flags.
Game 19 of #UniversityChallenge was Exeter vs Bristol. Bristol got going at the start and never looked back, rolling with momentum, finishing with an incredible score. Exeter only clawed their way back to 0 after 17 minutes.  I liked the question on common terms in Chinese place names, such as 北 (běi) in Beijing etc. Good geographic knowledge shown.
#UniversityChallenge is back from the Christmas alumni series, and game 20 was liked greased lightening in comparison. Darwin Cambridge Whitaker tore into questions like a monster, but everyone was in good form on that team and also on Edinburgh. Momentum changed through the game. Good quizzing. Three more games in round two, then the long quarter-finals.
It's quite a change to go from the Christmas series of #UniversityChallenge, where four people didn't know the name of the narrator of Moby-Dick even when told his name is in the first sentence of the book, to the regular round, where they're racing to buzz on questions like "Fifty-three British thermal units is to grouse hunting as Sydney, Australia, is to what famous star of the London stage?"
Game 21 of #UniversityChallenge was Wadham Oxford vs Imperial. What a game! Astounding performance from Imperial.  However, being King Crimson fan, I was disappointed that no one recognized them from the opening of "21st Century Schizoid Man," and dismayed when someone thought "I Zimbra" by Talking Heads (with Fripp on guitar) was by the Bee Gees. Can't have it all. I remain incredibly impressed.
Game 22 of #UniversityChallenge was Christ's Cambridge vs St Edmund Hall Oxford, two small colleges, but that's how the rules are set up.  Nice picture round with the Dunning-Kruger effect, Asch conformity experiments, and bouba-kiki effect.  Another on mushrooms, which seemed tough to me; identifying them by eye is not easy. Solid game, good playing all around.
#UniversityChallenge game 23 was Cardiff against Queen's Belfast. Ended with a lower score than I felt it would get, maybe due to missed bonuses, but the starters were buzzed fast. Nice flag knowledge, and a good picture round identifying physical laws by diagrams of experiments. A bit too much bantz for my taste, but a solid game. One more before the quarter-finals.
Just fell down a Doritos rabbit hole
headding down to CVS harmacy to pick my wife up some tissues (medicated due to sickness) so i'm hungry after my work day of looking at computer screen and i pass the snack aisle and my attention is pepsi universed to a little bag on the shelf that is doritos. but of course it is not regular doritos but rather the bag is all-black with a neon sort of aesthetic to it and the dorito bag prominently displays the words DORITOS: LATE NIGHT. of course under a crease the sub-flavor is "loaded taco"
so of course i pick it up and i eat it and it tastges like the taco bell beef seasoning mixed with nacho cheese with that little hint of somehow synthesized taco bell lettuce and it tastes spot-on, big prop to the dorito scientists who are in hell, but i continue to be plagued by the concept of doritos late night line. flavors that are representative of late night. i begin to think: what other late night flavors are possible? Several Beers flavor? Indica Nightmare?
its then that the immortal words of mao resonate through my loaded taco skull to go investigate instead of fantasizing about Difficult Conversation Doritos so i go and try to track down doritos late night line. 500 food products are released to the US public every year and about 480 of them disappear within 6 months and pepsico knows this which is why they don't do any marketing or advertisement - blind drops at the corner, secret boxes where the arrival IS the announcement. theres very little
what i manage to collate is this: there are three other flavors of late night doritos: Sizzlin' Cheeseburger (?), Last Call Jalapeno Poppers (??) and "Chili Sandwich", which is not a flavor. however in my attempts to find out anything about the doritos late night line, i stumble upon DORITOS AFTER DARK @ THE CRYPTO.COM STADIUM, the official doritos concept restaurant. thinking that the marketing is perhaps a near-miss, i nearl yclose the tab but for spotting LATE NIGHT in copyright font.
what i have concluded is as follows: - doritos after dark, which is not a chips brothel, has nearly nothing to do with doritos late night, despite both being named the same thing and having near-identical branding. i assume this is something like when your older brother gives you a shirt with his name monogrammed on the lapel - everybody responsible for doritos after dark is going to loaded hell
we don't necessarily need an ersatz munch squad about this - we live in america, the average manhole leads to the garden of earthly delights original mario bros movie style, so why should the lakers arena be necessarily different. it's, like, fair food, no worse than fried oreos. even so, there is something perhaps post-fierian about the ramen-rito, a burrito where the primary carbohydrate substrate is cooked ramen, and which advertises "fresh scallions". Uh, yeah, I sure hope it does.
to dine here is to reap the wine-dark benefits of being a ticketholder at the crypto.com stadium, home of the fucking lakers - i don't know how much lakers tickets cost, but i do know that the lakers are basically the yankees of basketball, which means the price of a ticket is counted in teeth. so yes. "Kick it up a notch." "Taste a bold new act." wh - why is that doritos bag so *airbrushed?* it's giving adam sandler click. but i'm nitpicking here. It's your The Lakers, you choose the food.
Nah.
you know that picture of the guy with the shirt that says 0 fears and then bart swimpson porn is banned so it says 1 fear? It's similar to that except now i am afraid to eat the home cooking of anybody i do not know intimately because there is a slim yet extant chance that i might sit down to a delicious home cooked normals dinner to eat with them in their house and similar to judas at the famous dinner they might kiss my cheek good-like then serve me up "COOL RANCH BISCUITS WITH HONEY BUTTER"
like ther eis undoubtedly, because the world is so so so sosososoo big and we are so small one person per person and information is so big and free, somebody who has made this, and then served it to someone who does not have the same brain as them. homecooked food is meant to be eaten. like it's a social problem now, sitting down in your breaksfast nook, or your table, and your wifey brings in a charcuterie board, like this, and you have to eat it. or it's bad for you. like as a person.
there's a lot of things that are wrong with america. this doesn't clock the 15th percentile. it's just an average sort of excess, another straw on the like last descendant of the great plains buffalo's ailing back. even so, even being as jaded to the way that americans eat as i am, having ordered a one-scoop cup of superman flavor ice cream last night, i find that i have not and could never reach rock bottom. there is a 121st day of sodom, my uncle who works at nintendo told me about it.
🧵 Indigo's journey to a new life! A thread Note: all major updates will start with the thread emoji Im attempting to move to Germany and find a new life! Follow this thread to follow this journey The last 32 hours or so were HORRIBLE! Panic attack, extreme fatigue, nausea. But! Look at where I am! The airport!! I fucking did it! I pushed myself too hard and ended up not sleeping for 32 hours. As of right now (write now) I am on the 33rd hour :p. Looking back, this is the way, and it wouldnt have happened any other way. ADHD is a Tanzanian to tame.  EDIT: tazmanian. I have done so much in the last 3 months! I thought it would have only taken me 1 month, but severely underestimated EVERYTHING. Rebooked the flight twice, but with 2 deadlines, this plane is it!  Gosh.. I met with realtor, packed (most) of the house, gave a 1/3 of my stuff away, the appropriate ppl have access to the rest, and my sister can be a PoA should need be. 7 or so documents apostille'd, degree recognized in Germany, language coarse booked, (potentially a scam) appartment rental reserved, vital documents ascertained! I also have a internationally certified document proving I am not a criminal! ITS GO TIME!
🧵 Officially in Germany! Got my Visa, new SIM card in (Spain) and awaiting the train to Köln. Gotta be honest. I screwed myself with bags. Too heavy for this smol trans girl 😅. Navigating where to get my luggage was fun! Turns out connections via train from plane are elsewhere. I'm usually pretty collected, but its a bit of stress Ill be honest. But only because as-it-stands right now, I have no support systems. I dont know this city. Have heavy luggages. Etc. Etc.  I have never been more parched in my life!  Ps: I have a story from the plane that isnt appropriate for fedi. And thats saying something! (doesnt involve me)  Booked a hotel (yea yea.. Late on that.. But i SHOULD have an appt. Tomorrow.)  First impressions of Germany: architecture, even of the steel & glass of the train station, does not dissapoint! Germanic design totally didnt play any role in my choice of destinations 😝.
Okay, the first German words to learn will have to be train & transit related. Future Indi, make a note! Seattle & San Francisco are the best public transits in America [citation needed] and once you figure it out, it really is zip zap zoom on and off and you're there! I want to get to that, but even living in Seattle it took me a few months.
🧵 NOTE: Do NOT get on on the opposite end of the train when carrying 3 bags! I took note of the prev train and prepared to whre I thought was car 1. Im that bumbling American today 🚬😎
🧵 A simple breakfast, but god is it good. I sure hope lactase enzymes are easily accessible in Deutschland, or else Im in trouble 😅. Nom nom nom 🥐
🧵 I got my keys! Sweaty, hot, and went through an ordeal getting the keys from skeevy old man neighbor-building landlord who was totally hitting on me. Ugh. Sometimes it sucks being cute.  Do i pass or something?! Or does he not care? XD I meet my landlord on Monday for anmeldung registration paper, mailbox name, contract (that I asked for) and the like. Ive been told having the keys bestows some tennant-rights/protections so we good.  Appartment rental for 3-months though! Lets gooo EDIT: Reposted with keys erased
For those wondering, I still have my hotel room. I played it safe and didn't want to rely on being able to get keys yesterday with luggage in tow
🧵 I now have a German telefonnummer! Exciting! That travel sim I bought did help bridge the gap, but the service was horrendous and relied on roaming. I was also under the impression it could dial out, which it could not. I already needed to call a German number. The SIM salesperson was also an expat (not american) and I had the nicest conversation! He wanted tips with learning programming*, and I asked how long to learn German and he was super inspiring! Saying that those who must learn—like for work—learn much more and faster! He encouraged me to keep with it and in 3 months I should be fine 🫶.  I will try to keep my numver when I inevitably switch. I chose this from convenience. Being that he didnt even require me an address, only an ID to activate.  Aside: no, I didnt think D-Netz was a Deez Nuts reference... Ofc not xD. You're silly for even thinking that haha (*hes starting in Python! Which I think is the MOST fun, even if someone has to unlearn bad habits. I think its a valuable litmus test for those to see if programming is for them)
🧵 Today's agenda: 1. Finish professional CV (most important!) 2. Find out how to get to private German language coarse (starts tomorrow, in-person).  3. Trip to appartment from hotel with backpack (slowly bringing stuff over. I overencombered myself) 4. Eat out! (food! Get ur mind out of the gutter! Lol)  Im delaying being a tourist. I found out about the Köln-karte, a tourist 1-2 day pass that lets you do stuff. I dont nessisarily WANT to delay being a tourist... But shit has to get done. Ya know? Its different when I'm trying to establish a foothold.  Plus it'll be good to do it in the week. Im in Köln M-Th for classes at 16:00-18:00. Meaning I could spend the best portion of the day outside ☀️💜 Know what didnt make the cut? What i had to nix? My fucking drawing tablet! It was an old Galaxy Book (wacam digitizer). But I really wanna draw! Thats how I want to visit Germany. Go to random place. Sketch. People watch. Sketch. Sure... Paper... But have you USED a digital canvas? Lol. Maybe Ill buy a used ipad.
🧵 Time to go grocery shopping in this tiny town of 75k. Kinda nervous. --- Also I got bumped on my language course 😭. Not enough people this cycle.  I inquired about normal attendance and they said I just so happen to get unlucky, because their A1.1 course is their most popular. But its all good! They DO have an online course that starts next week. Ill probably take that, even though I wanted to be in person for multiple reasons :p. Ill get started with my vocabulary with Anki/SRS in the meantime. LetMeTellYou I can study well 😬
🧵 My first homecooked breakfast in my new home I made thebstrawberry compote from scratch using fresh strawberries. I had no spatula, coffee water from stove boiling. Everything is slightly harder without my wares :p
🧵 A trick to ordering food in Germany: If a number is called 5 times, it's your number
🧵 Even the dogs here speak German! They are all wauwau insteaf of Bark Bark
🧵 Omgosh free TV! I was thinking of buying a used one! And it says it works? Cant read the rest. Must not be important. Well! I found out what the rest says! It says that the stand is broken and will fall down the tile stairwell making the absolute loudest sounds possible if not careful! Noted
🧵 I swear... Every day in a new country is an absolute adventure! Nothing is easy!not even ordering coffee and treat. Tasse cafe creme **gestures 1 finger up and points to pastry I dont even know what its calle din english** I KNEW she asked if it was for here or to go. I tried to gesture to go. But... Well.. End result is I ate in. Asked for a Kästchen on the way out. Got a bag! Alright! That one Ill count as a success. Anyone else's first days a whirlwind? I feel like Ive been here for weeks. No exaggeration! The midday naps in which I sleep harder than a tardigrade in a global ice age probably doesnt helo my sense of passage of time :p
🧵 So I was upset to give away my Sodastream and Restaurant sized canister mod for it, because I've been big into fizzy water and making homemade healthy sodas. TURNS OUT Germany LOVES FIZZY WATER! You actually have to specify Flat sometimes! 😅  I just like it because when it's overcarbonated and you drink it and it's so intense it hurts... it feels refreshing!  🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧
🧵 Okay... I dont want the honeymoon phase to end >_>. More great German things plz :P Okay. There are some downsides. All food tastes so..... how do I put it... German XD. Comically so! I've eaten Korean, Chinese, Taiwanese and Japanese cuisine now. And all of them have the distinct taste of.. sauerkraut?? But, it's in the rice itself. The part thats supposed to be the most neutral of flavor. I made Gnocci Carbonarra (white sause) and, while it was funking delicious, tasted like Brätwurst. I thought I was safe making food at home, but I'm not xD.  Now, I've eaten authentic italian in Syracuse NY (it's an italian historic city) and been to Taiwan. So I wonder if given time my taste buds will adapt and I will think everything tastes like how I remember it. Like as if there are subtle tones I'm just not used to yet 🤔 . And hense why I THINK everything has a foreign taste to it. Aside: Also these arn't new foods to me so Im comparing them to what I know. Versus trying... say... Ethiopian cuisine (something new)
🧵 I am not officially registered in Germany! Anmeldung in-hand! Woo 🎉 And I knew a lot for German than I thought in this exchange! I practiced German and she practiced English. (we both were being humble, but her English was good)  "Im sorry to ask... But are you man, woman, or divers?" 💜💜 We proceeded to talk about that. And she said she wondered if maybe thats why I come from states and I was like: yes, its so nice to hear other people understand. Omg. She said shes happy that people [like me] come and see Germany as a safe place 🫶
🧵 Netflix has joined the list alongside Ebay, Amazon, and Zelle in deactivating/locking my accounts due to 'suspicious activity'. And amongst the greater list of systems putting me in what we'd call "The Bad Flow" at work. (The flowchart of what the worst-case scenario looks like for a probable bad-actor). Freenet Funk denied me 3 times, but the 4th went through. FINALLY received their sim card. Expatrio did finally accepted my totally valid proof of residence after declining it the first time (my literal proof of anmeldung, which they stated is valid...) and unlocked my account last week. And the money that went into the void? It did turn up. So not all things are perilously bad, but I am literally swimming upstream against a system hellbent on making my life as difficult as possible. And here is where I could talk about systemic oppression being literal digital systems, and how these issues wouldn't happen to someone who came over on a job transfer. But I came over the hard way, unregistered, and flagged one system which I'm sure triggered the next and the next. It all started around when I stopped doing tourist stuff :P. But ultimately my suspicious behavior is abruptly moving overseas. I was explicitly told so by the ebay personnel on the phone. (They even told me it's extremely unlikely for someone to move countries. so in ebay's case it sounds like you'd always get flagged). Aside: A victory, buying laundry tokens from the hausmeister! I memorized a few words and shit bricks when I WhatsApp'd him and he called me immediately on the phone xD.
🧵 My house was robbed. Also, I'm sick again?! A relapse? I better get better before surgery in less than 23 days...
🧵 Add Paypal to the list of accounts I got locked out of. Absolutely unbelievable... Unfortunately, I dont know how to resolve this one. I tried calling US paypal and they wont touch German Paypal (I have 2 accounts. I'm supposed to have one account per country according to Paypal FAQ). But I dont know German to navigate a fluid conversation like that of unlocking an account. And having someone help... is... this is sensitive stuff. So I'm at a crossroads.
Where sabalenka got the easy win. So it's going to be tough for perlini if she's going to beat this version of sabalenka because she hasn't beaten sabalenka in over three years. If perlini's going to win this one, she needs to be defensive and get everything back against sabalenka and hope that sabalenka maybe throws in a few errors after a long extended rally because we can see that that happens sometimes when perlini is playing types of players that do have big shots. If sabalenka's going to win this one, she needs to serve well and be patient and realize that there is going to be a lot of shots coming back and she's going to have to probably hit two, three, four extra shots each rally, so she's going to have to be patient and she's going to get the win. Top 10 clash, really fun matchup, but i have to go with sabalenka in straight sets. I reckon it might be closer than the miami match because of the clay courts being a little bit slower than the miami fast courts a couple weeks ago, but i have to go with sabalenka in a close straight set, but let me know in the comments below who's making the final.
Gotta watch a netflix show you feel me, but let me know down below. What show should i watch on netflix though? Because i'm i'm really having some trouble to find what show should i watch on netflix because sometimes it's super hard because every every week there is their new show every month. There's a new show. There's a movie. There's a movie series i don't even know what's going on on netflix. But look that's for the little dude, man. That was the video, man i talked so much but look i'm tired man your boys tired man look, that was my night routine. If you enjoyed this video man, leave a like down below that's for the little dude. It's your boy dro to saucy man stay saucy, man. I'm out that gleam. Yes, sir
Curve line up, down, connect on the left, and i'm going to go one, two, three, four little dots, and on the right -hand side, i'm going to do it again. I draw a curve line up, over, curve line in, connect, and i'm going to draw one, two, three, four little dots. I come all the way up to the top, and i'm going to draw a straight line, straight line, keep going, keep going, all the way across to divide up that space, and then i come down to the bottom, and i do straight line, straight line, straight line, all the way across.
And physical appearance, attractiveness, also some have shown that it can lead to higher earnings but then in other studies it shows that it can intimidate people and doesn't always have good outcomes. So there's a lot of variability with these studies. So that was the women too? Yeah, yeah. Round faced women? No, no, no. With the breadth of face, it's male alone. You were too busy looking at mike, you weren't still, weren't you? You were distracted. Hype can assist females and physical appearance has got benefits across males and females and females in some areas but not all areas. I can't believe that they've actually looked into this. They have. Everything is there to be studied. Oh my goodness. Okay. Thank you so much mark. Good to chat. Absolutely.
And then into our criss -cross vaulters. And then, whisk to the left. Now, the man's gonna do a whisk to the right and the lady's gonna do an underarm turn. So she turns a quarter and then does a spot vaulter into promenade, but also what we call the cuddle position. Now, samba walk on the left foot, then a samba walk on the right foot. Now the rolling off the arm, no bounce action, and then samba walk on the left, samba walk on the right, and then a one to three of the rolling off the arm. And now we'll do the ending number two, which is where the lady does like a turning three step, the man whisks, and then we go into the reverse turn.
Get decoloration on my face so i get decoloration on my face if you can see i've got these spots on my face a little bit so i use up close and personal. Hi guys. Um, i use this wonderball hashtag not sponsored there you go, oh, this is very melted and i just might just put it on my face like this and rub it around. It smells really good guys smell it doesn't smell great. Yep and the reason i use my two fingers right here is because apparently i learned from my mama my mom was the best the best is the best best is always the best who comes from the best who came from the worst ones with the best cuz that made no sense

Now if you're struggling and you can't keep up with my pace, just stop when i stop, there's no issue with that. Last one. Squeeze, squeeze, well done. Okay, up you come. I want the drink at the end, okay? We're almost there, two exercises left, okay? We're running man for twenty, then hot hands, let's go.
Sort of doing their own thing and you know, that's that's pretty chill with like what everyone else is doing but like like hey, like if you want to like, you know, try to make a name for yourself that's what you got to do yeah. All right. So the question is what is one piece of advice you would give to your younger self? I would say to tell myself that i can always like take time for myself i sometimes get like so caught up and just doing everything in everyday life schoolwork activities all of that. So just like reminding myself that i can always take time for self -care and like time for myself and my friends and do you think your younger self would listen to this advice that you just gave?
The prophet samuel said that goliath could be defeated and that he would be defeated by a boy. David volunteered to take on goliath, armed only with his slingshot. It was a skill he had honed as a boy, protecting his flocks from roaming packs of wolves. It was a simple weapon he would take into battle. The giant in an arrogant moment says, why have you sent this shepherd boy? Boy, i will eat him alive and i will throw his carcass to the sheep. David took his sling and a few well -rounded pebbles. He swung and fired a stone, which caught goliath in the middle of the head.
Bathroom is clean and it just looks and feels so much better i ended up just putting the sheets there because i didn't know where else to put them so they don't look bad there honestly or at least fold it in ready to go and then those two boxes have just like some hair products in them that didn't fit in there so just like a little storage corner, which is fine because this bathroom doesn't even get used often anyways, so yeah i just got these towels from the bathroom i also have some kitchen towels that i brought up that i'm gonna put a load on right now because i especially need to wash the kitchen towels and may as well just wash everything at the same time and having clean towels just feels really really nice and i try to do this once a week they're due for a wash actually kind of overdue. So let's put them in the wash and do another load
Because i have some like pajamas and stuff. I totally forgot i had this. I definitely am going to move this up a couple spaces so i remember to wear this because that's such a cute vest. I'm done clearing things out. This is more like workout stuff. So i think what i'm going to do is i'm going to roll these up and put them with the workout pants because i never see these items in my closet when i'm going to work out because i just pick something random. So i'm going to roll these up and put them with the workout stuff so i can gravitate towards these more often. I think i'm going to put these...
You don't want a shot where the face is in the middle and then the second half of the photo is sky you want your face to be on the top one third line preferably where two of the third lines? Intersect this can be on the left or it can be on the right now let's say that you're standing in front of a viewpoint of some type you want to do a second thing now and that is to place the most important element on the other third line, so here's what i mean let's say i'm standing in front of a lavender field and there is one stone house out in the middle of that lavender field you want to place that stone house on the right third of the photo, so i'll be on the left third i'm looking at the camera the stone house is on the right third now. You have a perfectly composed photo
Sometimes we don't change anything. Usually we change one or two stories, so one of us will have to rewrite something, most likely. But this way we can kind of get ahead of it, start doing those newsfuse stories. And this is one of those days where we have four randomizers. It's going to be a big pull. Also, you can see sarah has gotten in and put in one of her discussion stories. I mean, you guys may think, like, there are such flockers, they haven't been in there. They're working outside of the dock a lot. You don't want to work in the dock. You notice that i didn't even work in the dock all that much. Because, oh, and i forgot to put my notes in there. Better do that before i'm forgetting it. Because the dock may crash, and you don't want to lose your stuff. So all this tells me is when they've really decided, like, oh yeah, i'm definitely going to do that story. So she's actually taking on...
We'll use ctrl f to open up find and replace we'll go to replace and you can see i've already entered the question mark that i want to find and a blank space that i want to replace it with. You can see excel thinks it's done what you want it to where in fact it's just removed all of our values but what we need to do is include an additional symbol which is known as a tilde so i'll just click in front of the question mark i'll hold the shift button and then push the hashtag button as well and you can see we have this new symbol just check i still have a space in there that i want to replace the question mark with replace all and you can see it has now replaced our question marks we'll then replace the question mark with an asterisk and you can see it has now done that for us as well. Please don't forget to like if you enjoyed this video
I have an even finish, so i will be able to see any of the sanding scratches left by the da, but now i'm going to move on to some 600 grit wet or dry paper. I already stuck my paper, pre -soaked it in the water. There's a couple drops of soap in here to help clean the surface of the wet sanding paper from clogging. The other reason for why you're wet sanding is wet sanding doesn't allow the material to clog the paper. Same as before, 30 degrees, slide, crosshatch as you're trying to work out those da swirl marks.
And disgust. Whatever that reason for that being because we see the look at it's on his left side which would be your right side looking at the screen when this thing starts again. So you see that i can't do it little thing this little part of his nose goes up and my impression of it is it's anger. He's probably mad because he's there he's mad because he's thinking about that the situation that happened during that time she's brought up so that could be what's firing that off. Again his blink rate let's keep an eye on that and let's even he's got that tick where his eyes closed. I'm counting those as we go through and i'll say i think it's this many blinks for his blink rates gone up or down. I'm counting those as well. So all right we're good.

Each guy in the band got a dollar every day. So you can imagine going through that when you have this opportunity, you just have to take a minute, you know, don't be an idiot. Don't blow this. Use some common sense. Get yourself signed to where you have an opportunity. And from there, from there, we started, you know, signed with an agency and we started opening for other bands, queen and other bands that were out there. We didn't have a manager. We didn't have an attorney. We didn't have an accountant. It was just the six of us with our arms linked and we're going to go out there and kick every band's ass that we could find and every night when we opened, we were going to blow them off stage. Well, obviously we didn't do that all the time, but we tried.
The first regulator. During the new tank install a soundness test was undertaken and no issues could be seen but this wasn't actually a full visual check of the system. Thus the unprotected and only partially galvanized pipe work went virtually unchecked. In 2002 another soundness check was undertaken during a regulator change and again no issues were reported but again this wasn't a visual check of the system. So i need to address the rather confusing naming of the site. I've been calling it so far the stockline plastic site although it was actually called and owned by icl group. Me calling it stockline was no mistake however due to stockline being the main public facing part of the business. In fact if you wanted to buy
It's also so aesthetic like look at this. Look at the packaging. It's so cute. Like are you kidding me? Here's the box that it comes in it says get into flow stay and if you guys know me that's literally right up my alley and i just have this in my fridge laying like this so that i can just grab one in the morning and it makes it so easy for me so if you guys want to shop magic mind and get a case for yourself um, you can use the code mckayla20 and you can get an exclusive 28 off your order so the link will be down below and everything that you need so go check that out and with that being said, let's do this. Let's take the shot
Just barely see the heads of those screws. So it's coming out nice and level really flow is good let's watch these guys as they come in here right up this end be good that's two bags right there, so we'll dump that out like that and then i'll i'll move it around with my magic trial here you could use a gauge rake if the floor was more level but this floor is really out of level and then i got a screw head right there if you can see it the stuff's almost there. I'll just level off to those screw heads as i go. I got another screw head there i got another one there. So i'm just i'm just kind of moving it around leveling it to the screw heads
Now it says, if you disable this app, other apps may no longer function as intended. Your data will also be deleted, which i'm totally fine because i don't ever use it. So i'm going to disable the app. Now it doesn't uninstall it from your phone. It just goes back to a factory version of uninstalling. It is disabled now. Let's go back into the drawer and you will see that it's no longer there. So i won't be annoyed with applications that are in my drawer or it just won't be popping up or stuff being updated for it because i don't have it ready for it to try to work. So that's a disabled option. If you needed to bring it back, go back into your applications. If you don't have the option to choose from disabled, enabled or applications, it's always going to be at the very bottom and click on that. You see this abled and those are the disabled applications.
Keep your hand nice and high as you're blending and also keep your eyes open. This is a great way to see the shape that you're creating. Bear in mind when you're blending, you don't want to blend up too high. Keep that highlight underneath the brows to add some more contrast with the smokiness. Now if you feel like this isn't smoky enough for you, you can actually go in and reapply a little bit of that brown shadow, keeping this on the lower part of the lid. A little will go a long way, particularly because we've already applied our contour shade on the lid. So just very slowly build this up until you get the smokiness that you like. Now to add more smokiness, i'm going to take that gel liner and push this in between the lashes. This is a totally optional step. I know that some people find this a little ticklish, so you can definitely skip it if you want. But it does add a little bit more depth and a little bit more smokiness.
It's the other way there we go, you got nothing on me boy, i was so fast i'm ooh, i'm just so happy i'm so happy let's get some wood for some chests and then we can make seven shulker boxes i'm just gonna try to load up everything that we have but we will need to get a mending book. Sorry put it on our elytra these are gonna be shoulders v2 is because they're on my shoulders and i think that is goodbye from this place for a while maybe you can just lie down. There we go. Oh another thing too. Now that we have our elytra. It looks like it's going it goes up all the way
Just want to talk to y 'all for a hot second, nothing major. So, as you know, this is the olympics, right? So i want all y 'all on y 'all a -games. Kevin ain't here right now. Remember, i am the alpha dog. I got better lighting, better jokes, better craft service, and better moves. So zoom in on me, baby. Let me get some of that snoop close -up action, that real nice close -up. You know what i'm talking about? Yeah, let's do this. Right there, right there. That's what i'm talking about. That nice close -up action right there. I don't want kevin to get none of that. He don't get that. Because i don't think the camera goes that low. But anyway, y 'all get back to work.
Personal thought and self -reflection. So we're just gonna head over here and you know, you don't even have to buy this for real but you know we're just gonna look into this mirror and just look deep into it to see if we can wait and there it is, yeah, there you go and there you go you should have all the items you need at this point. Hopefully with these you'll be in a good spot in from here it's all about waiting on that call now for just a reminder this guide for finding work isn't for everybody in fact, you can make some substitutions for example you could substitute every item on this list for a camera and a totally not stolen version of premiere pro and try to make creative youtube videos in your local walmart about things you hate like finding a job and a long shot hope that in time it becomes a job so despite if you decide to make any substitutions or not, it doesn't always work out for everybody. So just in case

So that's it for today's ikea hacks video. I hope that you enjoy this one and give it a big thumbs up if you did and let me know in the comment section below which one of these projects was your favorite. I think mine. It's a tie between the wrapped frames because i could see myself using that in so many design projects in the future. Like, if i have a boring frame and it's simple enough to wrap it in fabric, that is something i will be doing from now on. But i also love that striped cabinet. The wooden bead poles are so cute and i love like the little exposed jointery on the edges of all the drawers. It's a great little piece. So yes, thank you so much for spending some of your sunday with me today and i will catch you all in my next one. If you're not already, make sure to subscribe to the channel.

Would much prefer to send someone a message saying hey, i'm doing this thing this weekend. You should come than saying hey, what are you up to this weekend? Do you want to come and join us one of them shows? Uncertainty one of them shows complete certainty and number three use texts as a as a way to assert your standards and to communicate your standards this was upon receiving a text message. She sent this i'm not really a one -hour time slot kind of a girl but if you want to take me on a date this week, that'd be lovely. She put a winky face at the end it changes everything it was a little wink, you know, it was playful the tone was right, but the standard was there
That's all for my morning skincare routine. I have much more to add because i'm still learning about the whole skincare community. I'm still learning about it and i'm willing to hear feedback from any of you guys on the products i should try out. I still need to invest in an eye cream because these dogs, i'm on my eyes, they're barking right now. I seem to get an exfoliant so there's some things that i still need to add to my skincare routine. Because i'm yet to put this video out as soon as possible because people have been asking for it for the longest time. I'm not even bragging, people have actually been asking. I'm like, oh your skin is this, this, that. Skincare routine and yeah, that's my skincare routine. It's really basic but this is what i have. It's nothing too crazy.
Okay. Let's move on to our clam. Again, stabilizing the pelvis and we open the thigh and we close. And in two, say we did 10 on the other side, we're going to do 10 here. Three and four, five. Again, you can place your hand on the pelvis just to give yourself a little tactile cue here. All right. And i lost count. I think we've got two more. And two. All right. Last one. And release. Okay. Moving on. Stretch the top leg. Take the bottom foot forward. Okay. Reach the leg away and relax the foot. Let's go to legs. Circle one.
Otherwise you need to pre -order the wyze phone too. I missed that point so we're ready to throw that out there if you order in june or july, which i know june is gone so if you order in july you get $75 off of wyze phone using my code you'll go to techless .com slash trevor and you'll use the code trevor at checkout you do that i get a kickback it helps out a lot and it's like a win -win situation for us but like i said, i am an affiliate for this and a light phone. I like both phones they didn't force me to say anything positive. They sent me the phone and said do with it what you will so they were still confident in their product. They were gonna let me completely destroy it. It's a great phone i highly recommend check it out $75 off in the month of july. God bless guys as always and take it easy
Mean in the end they were like, unfortunately our policy only covers x amount 30 days or whatever so and i'm like, all right, or it was maybe it was like 90 days but it was on like day 91 so like they probably could have done something but you know, i called the area store and they're like yeah, worst come to worst come to us. They're like, but area has a one -year warranty on all their stuff so just call the area hotline and they'll take care of you. That's cool
Top five scary movies. That's actually a great question for me. I'm actually a huge horror guy i'm running on street for sure is number one. You can have a dream about freddy krueger and i had one as a kid second on that list the saw count saw on my second third be friday 13th jason jason holds on that list text change. I'm asker or for it so hills have eyes hills have eyes is very slept on in very very scary in very graphic so if you are warning on that last one, you're not it's a whore do not watch hills have eyes ever
So i hope that was helpful. I've had a ton of people reach out to me asking how they can start a youtube channel because they want to do stuff like this as well. And so this is my video for you. I hope this is helpful. You don't have to necessarily make a youtube channel, right? It could be other things. Maybe you want to do tick tock or you want to be youtube shorts or you could do instagram or if you want to make content is really fantastic. I just personally really liked doing stuff on youtube. That's definitely where kind of my niche is. With all that being said, i hope that was really helpful. I know i went through it quick, but, you know, that's not what my channel is. I'm not like how to start a youtube channel, kind of youtube channel. I'm a dead animals youtube channel. But there are a lot of people who ask me how to do it. So i thought i would make a quick video on how i do it and how you can do it as well. So thank you so much for watching. If you like this video, be sure to like and subscribe below. And i'll see in the next video.
What i'm hearing is at the very most, even if you had a car, which right now you don't, so we can technically subtract that from this, $1 ,575 .76. So here's what i want you to do. I don't want you to go cold turkey just yet, but what i would recommend is pretend, so we're going to subtract it. We're going to do $2 ,600 minus $1 ,575 .76, right? Because there's always the human error in that you might have miscalculated something or i might have. So we're going to pretend like everything is the way it was, and this is how much you're going to be paying. This is where the budgeting is really handy. So we're going to do $2 ,600 minus that number. What i have is $1 ,024 .24. So
Extra runs and they they batted a righty and a lefty which made the bowler have to figure that out because he's aiming for that wide line because that's the longer boundary. Well that wide line to a lefty batsman's behind his legs and that's that's a wide so that's runs and they ran on everything. Meanwhile, pakistan running on nothing doing nothing to force extra runs look at this you can see the difference here of where their body is how it's presented to the umpire and that's the difference. They just turned everything into runs they knew that they were going after that wide line and they knew when to go after it get the boundary when to leave it. Good job team usa
Drip stuff. So first things first, you need a good coffee. I would recommend going to your local coffee roastery, get your favorite coffee and it needs to be ground for something like french press or a coarse table salt. So that comes in here where we have the super fine metal filter and then you just want to sit everything on top here. Okay, water. So with the valve closed we're going to put this on the top and fill it with filtered water at best. Now you can put ice cubes in here as well to make sure it's a cold extraction or you can put the whole thing in the fridge as well afterwards and i recommend using about 7 to 10 grams per 100 milliliters of water. Once that's done you can put the lid on.
This one, literally right here, right next to me. It doesn't fit because sometimes taper holders are a bit larger, there's different sizes of taper candles, but there is an easy workaround if you have a taper candle in a holder that you really want to use. And that is simply to melt the bottom side of your taper candle with a lighter or a match and let the wax drip in to the taper candle holder. And as it's still hot, press it into the holder and it's actually going to melt into the holder and kind of stand in the exact position that you want it to. And let's just say you make it a bit crooked when you stick it in, don't worry, you can pull it right out, re -melt it, and at some point, you're going to get it straight enough to where you like it and it's going to be stuck in the holder pretty well. My next tip is to remove sticker residue from your decor pieces. Now, i know that there's a whole low -dryer tip to kind of like heat it up and remove the sticker, which is great, but i always feel like there's still like a little bit of film.
On your skin. Now here we have the facial scrub to use this facial scrub you want to make sure to cleanse the face first which is the first step so you're gonna cleanse get rid of all the grease and makeup from your face and then you're gonna use your facial scrub so you're just gonna dig in give it a little mix and then you're just gonna take a generous amount and exfoliate the skin. Now this is best to hold in your hands like that since it's not a facial scrub with granules so once you have it in your hands you're just gonna use it and just rub the face as if you're using soap on the face so just exfoliate your face if it's get dry throw it out dip back in and take up a fresh bath and exfoliate your face with this okay
He was like you did so good, and i was like man. I don't know man. I was like oh i sit back i didn't like it at all. He said this isn't about you he said have you seen all the comments? Protestants that are saying that you won whatever one is saying about you online people that are making reaction videos to it he said this is about you, and when he said that i finally had peace and i said you're right it's not a who cares what i think it's good if i'm helping people if i look stupid doing it but i'm helping people who cares it's not about me all right that makes me feel a little better cuz i cannot stand watching myself every time i'm like could have been ten things better, but just got to be humble it's about what god is doing with what whatever the attempts are really good reminder
The anxious generation won. Where is disney high? Okay, disney high came like ninth, but 17 ,000 votes for 1 ,100 ratings is pretty impressive. Okay, the anxious generation, a rigorously researched assessment of adolescent mental health in the 21st century. Oh, i need to say that i won. I read - i was correct. The arrival of the phone -based childhood essentially rewiring the vixen is growing up. Okay, i think this could be interesting because i need to get off my phone and maybe this book will make me do it. Memoir. I predicted that rupaul is going to win because his face is big on the cover and his name is big on the cover and people just go, i like drag race, i like rupaul, i'll vote for that. That's my conspiracy theory. I also think the - oh, i really hope the gilmore girls one doesn't win just because i am so uninterested in that. I've never watched gilmore girls, i'm not interested in that, but that could win.
I think? Fit me? I think... oh, the matte one is the fit me poreless. But they're both maybelline. This one is just in the dewy finish, and then this one is in the matte finish. I really like how the dewy one looks on me, but i usually use the matte, and since i'm going over the summer, i figured i should use matte since i'm probably going to be sweating a lot. But i'm bringing this one just in case. This one is the number 310 in sun beige, and that's the dewy finish, and then this one is 238 in rich tan, and this is the matte finish. I got this cute bag from walmart. It was like $10, i believe. It's actually supposed to be for men, like to put all their...
The pain and suffering you have to go through to learn all this stuff. But it will pay off because when something clicks and you realize this is actually how the world works. This is what light is. You know, this is how atoms work. This is how our bodies function. And it's all made possible by physics. I think that's one of the most beautiful things you can, beautiful experiences you can have to to understand. So i would say it's well worth it, but don't be put off by the, you know, the kind of mechanical side of it.
I have expertises and passions. I have things that i love and that i care about and that i know about. I've written like a thousand non -fiction video essays, i'm kind of an expert on social media. I don't know how i hadn't figured this out, but like, using my expertises and my passions has been deeply enabling. And all of my early failed attempts at other books was because i wasn't doing that. So john, thank you for the years of practice here, and if i could give you any advice, it's apparently write a soccer novel. I'll see you on tuesday. I don't have any news regarding the sequel right now, but i am working on it. If you want to hear me talk more about writing, i have a very long video over on hank's channel where i answer many more questions that i was sent on twitter. And also, the book box is from life's library. We actually make more of those than we're probably going to need, just in case anybody needs some replacements. But we're releasing a bunch of those on discount at dftba .com if you want to check that out.
I do actually use staplers, and then i just got some premium staples for it, so all is good in the hood. So that is everything for this haul video, i hope you guys enjoyed and maybe found some tips or something, i don't really know.

He came, what seems to be the problem? That's how i go to my office right now. Son, what seems to be the problem? Can't you read the goddamn sign, son? The goddamn sign says, hot sauce and mild sauce with your meal, son. Are you trying to pull something, son? I remember you were one of them smart college kids. You used to go back and forth with your history just like you're going right now. You want to come in and jump on everybody because your forefather's been ran and chased by hounds. Well, that might not be living, but it sure as hell ain't buying. Buying is what these folks been doing going on three years. Buying, buying is buying about a thousand. Buying from us, fool. I should know because i'm the one that dropped the grease.
Feel like yeah, they only really wash my hair on like monday thursday really and sometimes like friday if i need to if i like feel like i have an event or something like an event by event.

Leading to the four. What's the four? Well, we have one, two, three, four. All right, so f. so i guess we're changing key, and we're gonna go to f. but we wanna do a two, five in front of f. so now we're thinking in a new key. Just for a minute, we're thinking in a new key. F, let's take f. one, two, okay, so there's two, it's g. three, four, five, so there's five, it happens to be c. so for this brief moment, we're thinking in our brains, we're gonna switch keys, and we're gonna play a two, five leading to the four. So that's gonna sound like this.
Start to the season she wanted off and so likewise 83 also off so that brought out another safety car. Christopher parrott involved in that but then great fights for third place especially as costello took the lead. Toth involved in a battle for second, third and fourth. A couple more offs that brought out another safety car. Some racing incidents. Hodson great restart finally to go into second place and that's what nailed that for him but no one was gonna stop michael costello who wins.
Go on their website, i'll put that link in the description. It shows you all the features, you can obviously take notes, record audio, mark up pdfs, add photos, and it has that shape thingy if you do a crappy circle, it makes it into a good one. Again, it shows you everything, it has integration into your apple watch, you can upload it to the usual suspects here for your cloud, even works on your phone if you have one as well. But the phone doesn't work with the pencil which is too bad, i would love to have even just on my phone to be able to quickly take the notes. Well, let's switch to noteshelf. So you can create, i mean you have a quick selection here to create your book, you can have a new one, you put in your color, your name, there are lots of options just to kind of decorate this if you so desire, i don't really care too much. These are empty books, i just created that so you can see there is a list. I usually stick with obviously that one that i'm working on.
This shade of blue in my closet because i think it looks really good with the tan so definitely gonna be packing this with me next up we've got this little gray tank the material of all of their clothes are so soft like i don't know how they do it but it's so buttery soft and really flattering to the body like it just hugs you in all the right places so this is just a basic spaghetti strap crop top this is so easy to throw on if you're working out if you're going for a walk if you're running errands like you could honestly style this a bunch of different ways if you're not just working out now that i've got this one i need in every single color. I love it so much. It is it's perfect. Okay. Here's the next top i think this one's my favorite so far i can't
They're finally they're like, i need a job, right? So as long as you show your sincere about it, because it almost is like a mad dash to get bodies back in stores, you really got to be mindful of that. But they're gonna bring you on if you're if you're genuine, if you're if you're being honest and upfront with them, it's almost hard to say no to this to this person that's interviewing for a part time job that has open availability. You know, they followed up that set themselves apart. Hopefully these tips work. If they don't, i mean, keep hitting me up with questions. I'll address them all. These are just some of the things that have worked for me. And that, you know, while my time managing at finish line, i've noticed, set a couple of the interviewees apart. I hope you enjoyed this video, drop down in the comments, continue to subscribe, continue to like the video. I ain't got nothing else for y 'all. It's a quick video. Peace.
Connect with it and a lot of people don't actually feel comfortable enough to be vulnerable online so they'll reach out to you and say thank you so much for sharing this because i've been feeling this and i wasn't sure that someone else was neglecting old friends blatant snide so this one i suppose is quite self -explanatory it's very easy to feel excluded and be exclusive on social media as well. It's something that i think we all struggle with and yeah
Let me stick this guy, every time i interview him, i spank him every time, i pull his trousers down, i say, you naughty boy, you naughty boy. Why would you want to peel another man? Why would you want to peel my trousers down? Sadly, you've got a nice butt. Your friends do that, your friends do that, your friends, i watch everything, i watch everything. My job is to watch everything. Do you like my bum? I've got another question for you, do you like my bum? No, i'm very alpha, i'm very alpha, i'm very alpha. Let's shift gears, let's shift gears for a second, let's shift gears for a second. If you're defending, you're losing, that's what they say. Hooker, ramirez. Hey! We're right back to what we're here for. Both guys, we thank.
I literally am obsessed. I'm so happy that i got this because i was running out of my old pack. It was the small, basic, like i think five color pack. And i've had that for literally like two years. So i saw this at target and i picked it up. I'm really excited. I'm gonna use this a lot for when i'm taking notes because i like taking pretty notes. So yeah, this is from target. And then this is my bullet journal. Yeah, it's a simple bullet journal. It's the one where it has like a really hard name to pronounce. Luke, luke term, look term.
Didn't expect that if i'm being a hundred percent honest. I didn't expect that i wasn't gonna make a video initially but i put out a tweet saying yay, and there was already a lot of confusion, which is understandable there is so much confusion around what is happening in america right now with the tariffs and there's a couple of points that i want to get to with that but first let's actually look at the prices of stuff so pre -orders for switch 2 will begin on thursday april 24th at launch the price of the switch 2 in the us will remain as announced on april 2nd at 40 at $449 .99 and the switch to mario kart bundle will also remain at $499 .99 mario kart world and donkey kong haven't changed their price which in the case of mario kart world we'll just say that's good
Let me show you the rest so i have this pair from h &m and i got the same exact pair but in red it's christmasy for this time of year, but also you could wear red anytime red is a universal color it's not like you just need to wear it in december and i've been obsessed with red burgundy like all those colors lately so it's very on point for me right now, but look at how cute let me give you guys a close -up look at how freaking cute and you can see the material. It's very loungey very soft they're low -waisted which i love and these are the exact same pants i have on right now i got these in an extra small. I am so obsessed. They're just so freaking comfortable i think i got them for 30 something dollars on sale and then as you could see the red matching top as i'm literally wearing right now. If you take a closer look at the material it's like super cute
Take us through them. Well, casual swearing was one of those that was particularly mentioned. The guide actually points out things like this machine's cactus or spit the dummy or even bring a plate as terms that won't be well understood and perhaps worth avoiding. But, you know, i think it's probably going too far to put words on a hit list. Most australians, and i think part of the richness of our culture is the language. And i think the goal is to use it, not neglect it, not hide from it, but make sure we're clear in explaining it, because there is a lot of irony around the australian language and new arrivals certainly find it a little bit perplexing. So do sometimes younger people as they hear the old timers use these phrases. Ok, mark, thank you very much for that. Appreciate it. Cheers.
